      <p>I don&rsquo;t know how to write a poem that isnt a eulogy</p>
      
      <p>I don&rsquo;t know how to perform knowledge in a way that doesn&rsquo;t feel parodic</p>
      
      <p>i am on the run from a memory whose primary inscription is rewritten beyond recognition<br>
       <br>
      exiled from language, which remains the true site of my avatar &amp; the primary medium of this work called dead name</p>
      
      <p>am sch&ouml;nsten ist der gleichgewicht kurz bevor&rsquo;s zusammenbricht</p>
      
      <p>mein deutsch ist nicht sehr gut aber</p>
      
      <p>&#1101;&#1090;&#1086; &#1089;&#1083;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086; zusammenbricht &#1084;&#1085;&#1077; &#1080;&#1085;&#1090;&#1077;&#1088;&#1077;&#1089;&#1085;&#1086; &#1087;&#1086;&#1090;&#1086;&#1084;&#1091; &#1095;&#1090;&#1086;</p>
      
      <p>Dispiace&#8230; non &egrave; possibile cos&igrave;</p>
      
      <p>Bueno&#8230; contiene dos palabras. zusammen significa juntos. bricht significa romper.</p>
      
      <p>Actuellement en anglais c&rsquo;est la meme chose</p>
      
      <p>to collapse is to fall together</p>
      
      <p>
      you are holding that glass<br>
      like you can&rsquo;t see<br>
      it&rsquo;s already shattered</p>
      
      <p>
      We rolled up the stars and put them in the sky</p>
      
      <p>They will fall to earth again</p>
      
      <p>And we will sift through the rubble</p>
      
      <p>
      a disassembled volkswagen<br>
      The filthiest tanktop I have ever seen</p>
      
      <p>i see that look in his eye</p>
      
      <p>i smile</p>
      
      <p>i may be stupid but I&rsquo;m not dumb.<br>
      entropy never decreases</p>
      
      <p>I say, &ldquo;well, it wouldn&rsquo;t be any fun if I consented&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>so, we&rsquo;re making love, I guess</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>we walk along an empty road, past a grand country estate which seems hundreds of years old</p>
      
      <p>we are running through waist high grass</p>
      
      <p>the full moon rises and we take a moment to appreciate the moonshadows over the grassland</p>
      
      <p>we enter a hole in a fence, the moon splinters through the tree canopy</p>
      
      <p>there is no adjusting. no distinction between branch and apparition</p>
      
      <p>hand in hand in hand</p>
      
      <p>we trust we are on a trail</p>
      
      <p>if only because the way is not obstructed</p>
      
      <p>we hallucinate light shining through breaks in the canopy as puddles</p>
      
      <p>we bury our feet ankle deep in real pits of mud</p>
      
      <p>a tiny pulsing green glow on the forest floor</p>
      
      <p>i ask if i am imagining it, no, we are seeing the same sleeping firefly</p>
      
      <p>owls hoot in the distance</p>
      
      <p>branches crack</p>
      
      <p>we are not alone</p>
      
      <p>a low hum becomes an encompassing roar above us and we shriek, squeezing hands and pulling close together</p>
      
      <p>it slowly dissipates and we heave a sigh</p>
      
      <p>we sense steep elevation changes on either side, and struggle not to lose footing</p>
      
      <p>we find ourselves babbling to assure one another of our presence</p>
      
      <p>we fall silent again</p>
      
      <p>yes, that puddle is a reflection, i can see the mirrored movement of the trees above</p>
      
      <p>i step in one</p>
      
      <p>they lose a shoe in the mud</p>
      
      <p>i feel the blackberry bramble snag my pantleg</p>
      
      <p>we reach a clearing and see the moon again</p>
      
      <p>and scramble up a hill laughing in elation</p>
      
      <p>we reach the road again</p>
      
      <p>this is the road we came in on</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>I think of farting out cum on the dusty hood of his car</p>
      
      <p>he deprives me of the moment</p>
      
      <p>soiling the hood himself and bursting out laughing</p>
      
      <p>i can&rsquo;t help but laugh along</p>
      
      <p>I parry his attempted kiss goodbye</p>
      
      <p>With a soft palm on his solar plexus</p>
      
      <p>a paradoxical act of volition</p>
      
      <p>I thank him for a lovely evening</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>forgetting anything?</p>
      
      <p>mmm, baby I&rsquo;m forgetting everything</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>I am strolling through the city periodically interrupted by associations for which the primary memory is lost.<br>
       <br>
      Was I someone else?<br>
       <br>
      Where does the player character end and the interface begin?<br>
       <br>
      I am non player non character</p>
      
      <p>tomorrow I was a sprouting thing, spreading my first two leaves</p>
      
      <p>listening to radiant light and feeling a chorus through the soles of my feet.</p>
      
      <p>yesterday I will be a prayer</p>
      
      <p>sometimes the space between the mask and the soul feels impossibly vast</p>
      
      <p>sometimes words are spoken aloud only to confirm what has already happened in dreams</p>
      
      <p>there is somewhere between no future and utopia</p>
      
      <p>in a distant corridor, a candle flickers<br>
      we move inexorably toward</p>
      
      <p>I walk through the park and see elderly people dancing tango in a community garden</p>
      
      <p>I think of growing old</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>
      A memory returns as I think of somebody else.</p>
      
      <p>My memory's camera hovers just to the left of my head. I on my back and you somehow inclined over me. <br>
       <br>
      I can see my own face in the right periphery of the vision. You are faceless, headless.</p>
      
      <p>I only sense your hands.</p>
      
      <p>Your body forms a vague greygreen shadow, like a reflection through the side of a panel of glass.</p>
      
      <p>It lasts one of those dense eternal seconds in fantasy.</p>
      
      <p>I know already it must have been my room, and it would not be the last time we laid together.</p>
      
      <p>The bed must have been languorously deep and soft.</p>
      
      <p>The ghostly blue light at midnight after our eyes adjust.</p>
      
      <p>We must have already been talking only as gravely as first loves can</p>
      
      <p>for many hours already.<br>
       <br>
      My body was still blank but my residual self-image no longer reproduces it this way.</p>
      
      <p>You touched my chest, palms open, eyes closed, begging yourself not to forget me.</p>
      
      <p>I am a grown man reinhabiting my younger mind and our threadbare memory</p>
      
      <p>but not my body.</p>
      
      <p>If I strain I can bring the feeling of your hands on my hairless chest into focus. I cannot square the image with its sensation.</p>
      
      <p>As I think of conjuring her body in my mind at an instant I cascade through ten more darkened hallways I may never retrieve. <br>
       <br>
      I flipped the record and God Only Knows played</p>
      
      <p>I hardly paid attention to the song</p>
      
      <p>I rested my head in her lap and I felt a tear drop onto my temple</p>
      
      <p>and diffuse through the fine pigmentless hairs</p>
      
      <p>she asked me what it feels like to be in love</p>
      
      <p>I paused for a long moment and said<br>
       <br>
      'This.'</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>
      Like clockwork the sun rises over the concrete factory and the car, reassembled again, drives out of the gate</p>
      
      <p>i was not the one who made this decision.</p>
      
      <p>someone did, and we are dealing with the consequences</p>
      
      <p>halcyon microelectronics t shirt navy blue</p>
      
      <p>we&rsquo;re all driving<br>
      we&rsquo;re all falling asleep</p>
      
      <p>no replacing memories</p>
      
      <p>no destroying them either</p>
      
      <p>everything I thought was stable evaporated</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>he&rsquo;s the brain i&rsquo;m the legs</p>
      
      <p>we drank all the beers last night and we&rsquo;ll drink them again tonight.</p>
      
      <p>it&rsquo;s the least we can do</p>
      
      <p>we&rsquo;re doing barely anything</p>
      
      <p>we&rsquo;re just hanging out</p>
      
      <p>astral projecting to nowhere</p>
      
      <p>whats that called?</p>
      
      <p>right, dissociating</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>two banks of four spot welded steel cubicles seven feet high with swinging saloon doors and bar latches <br>
       <br>
      on the far wall light streams through stained glass and catches steam in the air <br>
       <br>
      on the outer panel of the cubicle is a small and meticulous etching of three peasants, drunk and asleep at the foot of an apple tree<br>
       <br>
      removing the drop ceiling in a 100 year old apartment expecting asbestos and finding hay<br>
       <br>
      is raving liberatory queer praxis?<br>
       <br>
      are there nightclubs in the utopia?</p>
      
      <p>ever think about what a decade&rsquo;s drug culture says about its context?</p>
      
      <p>opium, valium, acid, cocaine, ecstasy, &#8230; ketamine</p>
      
      <p>dissociation is a psychological response to trauma</p>
      
      <p>a last defense against a memory too horrific to integrate</p>
      
      <p>this can&rsquo;t be happening to me<br>
      this didn&rsquo;t happen to me<br>
      so it couldn&rsquo;t have happened to you<br>
      please don&rsquo;t ruin my memory</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>yesterday&rsquo;s liquid hallucination crackles into concrete fixity</p>
      
      <p>i learned to say i trust you before i say i love you</p>
      
      <p>the glass is already broken</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>gin martini, 2:1, if you have onions make it a gibson, otherwise an olive is fine</p>
      
      <p>&lsquo;you don&rsquo;t want that&rsquo;</p>
      
      <p>excuse me?</p>
      
      <p>&lsquo;you don&rsquo;t want your martini like that&rsquo;</p>
      
      <p>do you know how I know<br>
      that I like it that way?</p>
      
      <p>that&rsquo;s how my dead husband used to make them for me</p>
      
      <p>&#8230;.</p>
      
      <p>stirred, if you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
      
      <p>he returns with the drink</p>
      
      <p>it&rsquo;s on me, i&rsquo;m sorry for your loss</p>
      
      <p>have we learned a valuable lesson today?</p>
      
      <p>he nods sheepishly</p>
      
      <p>good boy</p>
      
      <p>I leave 20$ on the bar</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>a feeling doesn&rsquo;t have to be painful to be significant</p>
      
      <p>can I be heard if I am not crying out?</p>
      
      <p>three weeks ago I said I am trying to shatter my contemptible nostalgia</p>
      
      <p>and meant it</p>
      
      <p>the day will arrive where I look back and think</p>
      
      <p>i cant believe this happened to me</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>
      she says thank you</p>
      
      <p>i ask, why are you thanking me?</p>
      
      <p>things that are hard to hear tend to be hard to say</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>
      she said I could die so gracefully</p>
      
      <p>like I was never even here</p>
      
      <p>an imprint so engrained you forget its provenance</p>
      
      <p>slip past softly</p>
      
      <p>only always ever a slogan</p>
      
      <p>your lips</p>
      
      <p>a song nobody wrote</p>
      
      <p>i am more comfortable in the next world than this one</p>
      
      <p>my first memory was a bardo dream</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>
      in one of the only recurring dreams ive had in adulthood</p>
      
      <p>i am driving my red 1984 alfa romeo convertible, which belonged to my father in law</p>
      
      <p>the road is snowy and i keep sliding on the steep downhill</p>
      
      <p>i am prepared to crash</p>
      
      <p>i am already thinking about calling his dad to tell him what happened</p>
      
      <p>but the impact never arrives</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>i spend hours in virtual vestibules</p>
      
      <p>learning to use my body</p>
      
      <p>with sufficient rewriting, memories are converted to the third person.</p>
      
      <p>it takes 20 minutes to find my way out of the bathroom</p>
      
      <p>while my head balloons to 3 times normal size</p>
      
      <p>i am standing next to a well</p>
      
      <p>smashed flat into a jagged bug</p>
      
      <p>i disappear</p>
      
      <p>the world disappears</p>
      
      <p>and my torso bends back</p>
      
      <p>the fog becomes flashing needles</p>
      
      <p>I am walking up a burning staircase, clipping against the wall of fire</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>in the weeks before this show opens, i spend probably six hours on playstation emulation forums trying to figure out how to use cheat codes with my emulator, so I can buy the alfa romeo spider in gran turismo 4</p>
      
      <p>god forbid I earn the $30,000 of in game currency by actually playing</p>
      
      <p>i figure it out, and take some footage of the car within the game while it collapses</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>the day I finished installing, the car burned with my childhood home</p>
      
      <p>where i was conveniently storing most of my possessions</p>
      
      <p>every book<br>
      every record<br>
      every keepsake<br>
      all but my most practical clothing</p>
      
      <p>fate it seems is not without a sense of irony</p>
      
      <p>the girl who can&rsquo;t stop making art about grief and memory</p>
      
      <p>holding the digital archive<br>
      releasing the physical</p>
      
      <p>i am trying to shatter my contemptible nostalgia</p>
      
      <p>ok bet</p>
      
      <p>you have four necklaces</p>
      
      <p>my precious garbage</p>
      
      <p>the pressed leaves in a bible</p>
      
      <p>inscrutable color coded inscriptions on a copy of finnegans wake</p>
      
      <p>a gift</p>
      
      <p>from a person who would never know me<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I address you in my capacity as the title executor of the estate of Tvordis Veeler, my late husband, and as a curator whose work concerns digital preservation of cultural memory. I am the steward of my husband&rsquo;s most intimate digital device: his personal computer which he called Theseus. The worlds we will traverse are moments outside time between two local machines: his and hers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the twilight of his life, he promised me his computer, which he called Theseus, and challenged me to &ldquo;examine this archive of a mask in its incompleteness.&rdquo; To lift these files out of their grave and put them in places they would never expect to find themselves. Through this gift of his un-curated digital self, he ensured I would never be alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This grief ritual has been a central site of my work for many years now. His death formed an immutable rupture between before and after, and our life together is the well of inspiration that drives me today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unit of analysis of this practice is the word. Tvordis once told me that &ldquo;words are rocks.&rdquo; I have to keep reflecting on what this means to me, and whether that meaning has shifted. I think the gist is that people make meaning. Words are inert until translated in the mind and heart of a living subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We fell in love through text messages and when we finally got in bed together I whispered &ldquo;I left my phone for you.&rdquo; He was word before he was flesh. Now he is word again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found myself writing this same eulogy over and over since I transitioned. Forgetting is the left hand of memory. Art becomes a portal through time, a potent channel activated only after you&rsquo;ve forgotten making the artifact. Silly me, before I even called it art, the blueprint was written. We can come back to now, it will always be here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in a name?</p>
<p>A dead letter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>seven years ago my husband came to berlin and got a tattoo of an earwig and a sigil from finnegans wake</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and almost to the day i met a james from ireland who was the first to recognize the sigil as the union of the two brothers: shem the penman and shaun the postman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>exiled from language, which remains the true site of my avatar &amp; the primary medium of this work called dead name</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permanent abjection from normative category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The title of this series is an olive branch</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An invitation to step across with me into a convenient fiction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in a name?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is obviously a quote from romeo and juliet about the ties of family or whatever but in ulysses, bloom turns the phrase over all day as he thinks of his status as an immigrant jew in ireland, quite literally translating his name to assimilate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ulysses concerns exile from nation and problematizes nationalism itself by producing a definitively irish novel outside of ireland&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joyce signs the novel:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zurich</p>
<p>Trieste</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three cities where it was written.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the wake is an exile from language itself</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fleeing the strictures of signifier, sign, and linearity, everything is happening at all times at once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Constructed from words yet frequently labeled unreadable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>Last week i walked for hours and hours thinking about what i would post for my fourth hrt birthday&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took a day for reflection, and I&rsquo;m thinking about a fucking instagram post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my first birthday I found that I had worn the same brown a frame corduroy dress the day&nbsp; started hormones, and hemmed myself into a tradition of photographing myself in it on each subsequent anniversary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i remember three years stressing out about taking this self portrait&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always ended up taking it when the sun was a it&rsquo;s zenith, scorching and self conscious</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The least optimal light</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using my drone so I wouldn&rsquo;t waste my girlfriend&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>constructing my precious insightful little caption</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i think about joyce&rsquo;s viconian ricorso, a final step in a cycle of four like eddying out on the river of time&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>stepping out of a pattern and listening to the rhythm again&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>his favorite cigarettes were gauloises but I think I prefer camel blues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am leaving Oakland, driving back to Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking for a coffee and a bathroom before I go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I happen upon this cafe near Grand Lake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hand written chalk menus crowded with words. Faded yellow paint with crimson moulding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undesigned, in a way that indicates its longevity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No light wood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No hostile danish furniture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No 10,000 dollar espresso machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a pot of diner coffee sitting on a hot plate, above it hangs a sign that says &lsquo;complimentary coffee.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An older man stands&nbsp; behind the counter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tell, I don&rsquo;t want anything else, and ask if I can pay him for the coffee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He looks at me like I&rsquo;m crazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s free,&rsquo; he says, with a bemused smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coffee is so hot in the styrofoam cup. Only powdered creamer, which I forego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No lids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I burn my mouth ten times and nearly spill it on myself as I get on the highway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I hear that sound again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you have to help. I brought you a this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a what?&nbsp;</p>
<p>(insistently) this!!!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well you have to be something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;ok, today I am a spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>tomorrow I was a sprouting thing, spreading my first two leaves</p>
<p>listening to radiant light and hearing a chorus radiating up through the soles of my feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>yesterday I will be a prayer&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>sometimes the space between the mask and the soul feels impossibly vast</p>
<p>sometimes words are spoken aloud only to confirm what has already happened in dreams</p>
<p>there is somewhere between no future and utopia</p>
<p>in a distant corridor, a candle flickers</p>
<p>we move inexorably toward</p>
<p>I walk through the park and see elderly people dancing tango in a community garden</p>
<p>I think of growing old&nbsp;</p>
<p>i believe capitalism will end in my lifetime</p>
<p>this is an article of faith over logic</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>how do you feel when you hear these words?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Democracy</p>
<p>Community</p>
<p>Individual</p>
<p>Liberation</p>
<p>Radical</p>
<p>Care</p>
<p>Boundary</p>
<p>Trust</p>
<p>Conflict</p>
<p>Accountability</p>
<p>Revolution</p>
<p>Innovation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in a name?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the first days of the genocide I performed an essay called Obituary at Gray Area in San Francisco, on the same day Marc Andreessen published his techno optimist manifesto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked a question that I haven&rsquo;t stopped asking myself since October&hellip; why the fuck am I making art right now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>who is this for?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it is just for colleagues?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>god i hope not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i want to break containment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i want to be in the world</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it seems I can only write in transit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>walking and walking into things&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t research seeking logical substantiation of my arguments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i read for the solace of kinship</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am starting to think this is also why i make art</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what use is my vulnerability? what use is a speculative obituary for an unbroken body?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the epiphany of this fake death</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is what i am praying on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a revolution localized in my own body</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>another world seeping through the locks, seemingly from nowhere</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my husband ended his world as he knew it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and as he did so, mine began</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you think of an avatar, what shape does it take? Where is it allowed to exist?</p>
<p>Is it separate from you? A part of you? Is it clothes? A body? Your body?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forget.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>Anyway, we met and exchanged bodies.</p>
<p>Or he slipped out as I entered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>We were together there for a long moment before it got quiet again.</p>
<p>I promised I would remember.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wrote what we called a question in the form of a book. It was more like a rat&rsquo;s nest of dramatic assertions in the form of a hypertext.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People have seen it, read it, and contributed to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I removed it from the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible. And unfortunately the desperate thrashing thing is a codex that inscribes my fate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We evacuated the pages over three manic days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only breaking the loop through a ritual removal of my 18 month old rat tail. Thus severing the tether which bridged the rupture of our meeting.  My connection to this alternate reality eroded over the years, like a dream&rsquo;s traces washing off the conscious mind as it returns to waking life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I refer to it in moments of desperation.</p>
<p>I have worn through the fabric of that memory. It stretches far beyond its container.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize what I was doing until it was already done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then he was gone, just as quickly as he arrived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I was alone with a full suite of memories which are allegedly my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint an exact moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It feels more like a gradual handover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A body given and received with gratitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think about the inscriptions we leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After we are flushed back out of ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I think of our book that I cannot decode without him, which nonetheless animates the very fabric of my work here on earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I departed everything everywhere to become someone somewhere.</p>
<p>I feel my body in time.</p>
<p>I am walking an unruly dog.</p>
<p>When we cross the threshold together, home is always our destination.</p>
<p>Am I pilot or passenger?</p>
<p>led by this companion animal stopping and starting doubling back charging forward</p>
<p>Each time she stops, I take it as an invitation to listen to a world unpierced by my footsteps.</p>
<p>I place my awareness two inches in front of my forehead, crossfading cacophony and absolute stillness.</p>
<p>the places she pauses distant echoes of the waste accumulating in our cyclical wake</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sutured into a body that came with a complete set of memories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A plural experience mediated through an individual container.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time it freezes, I begin again.</p>
<p>Over and over.</p>
<p>I fall through the street.</p>
<p>Jagged polygons shoot out of my body mesh.</p>
<p>Completing the training mission as the game collapses around me.</p>
<p>Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Grand Theft Auto, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having the bardo dream again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I am James. Standing at the mirror in a filthy public restroom.</p>
<p>I go to the car. I find the map. I descend the stairs. I walk into the foggy forest. I reach the gate.</p>
<p>I am at the mirror again.</p>
<p>I deviate from the program. I walk up the road until I tell myself, yet once more, that this is the road I came in on, and that there is no use going back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill&hellip;&rdquo; Mary repeats in sotto voce.</p>
<p>Always looking for a girl.</p>
<p>He was looking for me.</p>
<p>And then for an instant I clipped through him.</p>
<p>Or was it him through me?</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>I forget.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>In part, this performance was an act of resistance. I would rather talk about death than VR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love to die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love it so much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tower rewards with regeneration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of the places I&rsquo;ve called home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the ones I&rsquo;ve been ready to depart at a moments notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While my husband, Tvordis, decorated his perfect Chicago loft in an old soda pop factory with matching mid century modern furniture, I was preparing for a reality where I could leave the country tomorrow with a Pelican case and a backpack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I wanted to die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of home computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computers I&rsquo;ve called home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the ones I&rsquo;ve been ready to depart at a moments notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My husband&rsquo;s computer, Theseus, is a lived-in laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost 15 years old and still works. We stopped updating the OS around 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three motherboard replacements, two batteries, optical drive long since replaced with an auxiliary hard drive bay. Maxxed RAM. Rehoused in an entirely different case. Tvordis was so proud of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He sits in that loft with Theseus, generating poetry using the latest open source machine learning libraries (Tensorflow and Keras) which he trained on Finnegans Wake. These models took days to train and their outputs were clumsy, exposing the edges of the algorithm. He didn&rsquo;t quite know why he was doing this, except that he felt he needed to. He felt like he was surrounded by a chorus of angels, sitting for hours at his computer with the fan whirring at full blast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three years later, he was dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wave of open source neural networks promised a new age of computing. It was possible to train a model on his personal computer. Seven years later, so called AI is ubiquitous &ndash; computer vision, machine learning, and the datacenters that underly it are distant and invisible. The cloud joins the local machine as a passthrough for these atemporal intimacies. The automated witness aggregates the intimacies of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An indelible impression becomes a confluence of memories worn through with rewritings, residing in the body and scattered across globally distributed hard drives. Alone with his computer, I performed the poems by clicking and dragging through them as a single line of text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was not the beginning of my life as an artist, but it was a beginning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of the body I called home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the body I was ready to depart at a moments notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaving the country next month with a Pelican case and a backpack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A memory returns as I think of somebody else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My memory's camera hovers just to the left of my head. I on my back and you somehow inclined over me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see my own face in the right periphery of the vision. You are faceless, headless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only sense your hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your body forms a vague greygreen shadow, like a reflection through the side of a panel of glass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It lasts one of those dense eternal seconds&nbsp; in fantasy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which will certainly replay like an unstageable film for several weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know already it must have been my room, and it would not be the last time we laid together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bed must have been languorously deep and soft. The ghostly blue light at midnight after our eyes adjust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must have already been talking only as gravely as first loves can&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for many hours already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My body was still blank but my residual self-image no longer reproduces it this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might never be satisfied with the word I choose to describe the way you touched my chest, palms open, eyes closed, begging yourself not to forget me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a grown man reinhabiting my younger mind and our threadbare memory&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but not my body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I strain I can bring the feeling of your hands on my hairless chest into focus. I cannot square the image with its sensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I think of conjuring her body in my mind at an instant I cascade through ten more darkened hallways I may never retrieve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I flipped the record and God Only Knows played</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hardly paid attention to the song</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rested my head in her lap and I felt a tear drop onto my temple</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and diffuse through the fine pigmentless hairs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>she asked me what it feels like to be in love</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I paused for a long moment and said</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'This.'&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>we walk along an empty road, past a grand country estate which seems hundreds of years old</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we are running through waist high grass</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the full moon rises and we take a moment to appreciate the moonshadows over the grassland</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we enter a hole in a fence, the moon splinters through the tree canopy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is no adjusting. no distinction between branch and apparition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hand in hand in hand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we trust we are on a trail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if only because the way is not obstructed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we hallucinate light shining through breaks in the canopy as puddles&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we bury our feet ankle deep in real pits of mud</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a tiny pulsing green glow on the forest floor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i ask if i am imagining it, no, we are seeing the same sleeping firefly&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>owls hoot in the distance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>branches crack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we are not alone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a low hum becomes an encompassing roar above us and we shriek, squeezing hands and pulling close together</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it slowly dissipates and we heave a sigh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we sense steep elevation changes on either side, and struggle not to lose footing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we find ourselves babbling to assure one another of our presence</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we fall silent again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes, that puddle is a reflection, i can see the mirrored movement of the trees above</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i step in one</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>they lose a shoe in the mud</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i feel the blackberry bramble snag my pantleg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we reach a clearing and see the moon again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and scramble up a hill laughing in elation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we reach the road again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is the road we came in on</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is your work about the body?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, whatever you want!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>should I put &lsquo;queer trans artist&rsquo; in my artist statement?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is your work about the body?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>well here the fuck I am reading you my fucking diary&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow your work is so vulnerable!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks I don&rsquo;t really feel like I have a choice!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the difference between an agent and an avatar?</p>
<p>The second essay in this series was called &lsquo;about my avatar.&rsquo; in this essay i contend that the avatar is more like clothes than a body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>when a cis person tells me trans people can modify their avatars, and that such a thing is liberatory</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;i think, motherfucker i modded my physical body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>but what about clothes?</p>
<p>in 2021 I released a world called The Projected Observer at Gray Area Festival. This one of the first serious presentations of my work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is a lot of irrelevant window dressing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really clothes for my first self portraits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>alone in my studio, topless</p>
<p>seeing my own tits for the first time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is a distilled gesture; the video synth is a distorted mirror, and my sight is what is being captured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in 2022 web3 boosters shilled an idea of a sovereign identity online. a bipedal anthropomorphic surrogate, which we were to dress in designer virtual fashion. trans people, i was told, would be liberated through their control of their appearance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about identity is sovereign?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two years later&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>time delay between camera shutters and an image appearing on michelle&rsquo;s laptop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i look in a time delayed mirror reviewing poses and postures</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>chin down</p>
<p>chin down</p>
<p>chin down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>eyes on the camera</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hear trans models are hot right now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a chaser who wants to pay my rent</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>is she submissive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>without question&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is she breedable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this has not been proven.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p>i remember being invisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a presence floating over a man&rsquo;s life ready to enter the scene when he was ready to exit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>he rode that fucking thing till the wheels fell off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i remember my first encounter with the shape that would become my avatar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>miss sammie radiates positive energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p>In her novel, Sarah, my friend Laura wrote a phrase I&rsquo;ve held ever since I read it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you are not only a figure of tragedy but a miracle in our midst&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sarah was one of my first major inspirations as an artist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story is incredible, but that which inspired me happened off the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See, Laura wrote it, but the author was named JT Leroy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laura got this book published in the year 2000 with a phone and a fax machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t need to have a body until she was asked to do a reading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Panic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until the tragic stroke of genius that sealed her fate befell her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She instantiated an avatar, piloted by her sister in law, Savannah Knoop, who played the androgynous proxy for the author, who is also protagonist of the novel. The novel describes the fantastical and miraculous experiences of an ambiguously gendered &lsquo;lot lizard,&rsquo; who went from town to town with their mother turning tricks in truck stops, switching genders for convenience and safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the next six years she/he/they rode a wave which I view as the high watermark of the broadcast media celebrity culture era.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vogue shoots, coke ads, called things like &lsquo;the next Truman Capote,&rsquo; the Bono talk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teri Gross interviewed JT, and it&rsquo;s hard to listen to how eager she was to believe this story about a child sex worker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what happened in 2006?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, the &ldquo;greatest literary hoax of all time&rdquo; was uncovered, and the walls collapsed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t like to be tricked, but sometimes it takes a convenient fiction to uncover a deeper truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it make you feel better if JT really did do all those things he described?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A year later, Laura was sued for fraud by the production company which was to develop the film adaptation of Sarah, directed by Stephen Spielberg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The production company won.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She remains controversial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is she stealing tranny valor?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another word for a convenient fiction is a hoax</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is dead name a hoax?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I stealing widow valor?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you feel better if my husband was dead?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are people who earnestly call themselves trans widows, but more in a &ldquo;you killed my husband&rdquo; kind of way.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this series started as a polemic wrapped in a eulogy, a confluence of technological grief (a term coined by my friend alice yuan zhang), and grief mediated by technology</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this was the era of peak metaverse hype where all around me, colleagues breathlessly transmuted silicon valley marketing into speculation on a future dreamed up in boardrooms by venture capitalist chuds and management consultants</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as a co founder of new art dot city, i was frequently roped into this discourse</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>new art city is an artist run virtual space which allows artists to create 3d multiplayer websites without code</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so like.. is this the metaverse?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s a fucking website calm down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in a name?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the longer i do this project, the more it feels like prayer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am sick of worlding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>suspicious of speculation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what qualities make a world?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when do words become worlds?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my instinct is to say that worlds are for living in</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>do I build worlds?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to the extent that I co-create a world I want to live in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most relevant feature of the &lsquo;in game physics&rsquo; of new art city is that space is not scarce. This alone inverts one of the longest standing and most pernicious features of making art under capitalism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there white cube galleries in the utopia?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does art need to be separate from the fabric of life?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my contention when I started this project was essentially that there is nothing about a third dimension in the browser that alters the phenomenological character of networked life</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as legacy russell so eloquently tells us, there is no boundary between url and irl</p>
<p>we are already jacked into a synchronous and interactive simulation</p>
<p>one day you logged on and never logged off again</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p>and so lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about linear algebra</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biggest glow up of 2024 is her rebrand as artificial intelligence&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sam altman and his effective altruist buddies tell each other ghost stories</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is this god?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking statistics please just be normal!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eliza was a mirror, nothing has changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we make art about stories of the future ripped from headlines of trade press</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you display insufficient reverence for the quotidian magic all around us</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not in a distant future but here today&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the metaverse, heaven is a datacenter</p>
<p>And the cloud is a place on earth&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the longest time I felt like this presence</p>
<p>hovering over the scene of his life.</p>
<p>A silent witness to an unfolding play</p>
<p>that I would one day have a part in.</p>
<p>some days I feel like an emissary of his vision.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting shape to carry.</p>
<p>the female archivist of the dead male artist.</p>
<p>one of the best ways for a man to increase the market value of his art is to die</p>
<p>Tvordis was in on the joke.</p>
<p>he released the tape in June.</p>
<p>in August, he was dead.</p>
<p>A few days ago made four years since he left the body.</p>
<p>for the past two years I&rsquo;ve been performing his eulogy as a lecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>in places where lectures are expected.</p>
<p>For two years I&rsquo;ve gestated this swimming memory</p>
<p>yet once more I wrote an essay when a poem was demanded</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>are we living in the end of history?</p>
<p>is art just entertainment for rich people?</p>
<p>am I a commodity contemplating itself?</p>
<p>is representation praxis?</p>
<p>who decided that there would be a second web?</p>
<p>who decided that there would be a first one?</p>
<p>will this consumer product contain the seeds of my liberation?</p>
<p>do I have to read the Benjamin to make myself understood?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what is the shape of capital?</p>
<p>what sound does it make when it accumulates?</p>
<p>are aesthetics politics?</p>
<p>are politics aesthetics?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then I read the Benjamin in a fit of desperation and feel understood myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>let me tell you about my late husband, Tvordis Veeler</p>
<p>This poem is a temporal duet&mdash; his words interposed with mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>born sam cortese in hollywood california in 1993</p>
<p>to parents greg and jocelyn</p>
<p>a child who spoke to adults hoping beyond hope</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t notice that he was five.</p>
<p>an infectious optimism</p>
<p>a personal reality distortion field</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>tvordis became tvordis two decades later, on a lark that would ultimately prove fatal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>he left the body in San Francisco in August 2020, a year after we moved there together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my first hour of knowing him, Tvordis taught me that not even death is death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t die, he lived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he showed me what happens when you turn off the lights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had the courage to end his world as he knew it.</p>
<p>And at that moment, my world began.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>he told me about the gradual unfolding awareness</p>
<p>that we came from another place and found each other in this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that we didn&rsquo;t choose to be born,</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t remember choosing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our last year, we were inseparable.</p>
<p>We shared everything.</p>
<p>and with equal measures of joy and desperation,</p>
<p>we tried to document as much as we could before he had to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what we made together filled a book and 11 cassette tapes</p>
<p>when he left, he gave me his personal computer</p>
<p>and challenged me to &ldquo;examine this archive of a mask in its incompleteness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To lift these files out of their graves</p>
<p>and put them places they would never expect to find themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>believing that the things he left behind would be retrieved.</p>
<p>the dead only exist to the extent that we remember them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been gone for four years now</p>
<p>and I still feel like an emissary of his vision.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting shape to carry.</p>
<p>the female archivist of the dead male artist.</p>
<p>one of the best ways for a man to increase the market value of his art is to die</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am wearing my pink camo pants and jelly platforms with frilly socks, a mesh bra and open silk button up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i sit in my friend&rsquo;s kitchen drinking coffee which they prepare like gong fu cha and serve in tiny cups</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>offhandedly they offer me a homemade mushroom chocolate from their freezer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i take one</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we stroll through neukolln, a bit late from chatting</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i see the police before i see the march</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>riot gear, but helmets held at their sides</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i remark about cryptic humor of the officer in a full face of makeup and white gel claws</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we fall in with the palestine block</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we march, we chant, i feel the familiar comfort of being a voice in a crowd. we chant in german, in english, in arabic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we laugh and count the shirtless men in their windows looking down at us</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the mushrooms are starting to hit, i smile feeling the warmth rising from my abdomen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i feel the familiar joy of strolling along in a sea of dykes as far as i can see</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we see police impotently holding cameras on poles, which demonstrators deftly block with banners and keffiyehs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>surrounded by adorable lace clad apple cheeked 24 year olds holding signs and drinking radlers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>before i know it, the police have their helmets on. they descend in pincer columns, grabbing a few protesters and pulling them out of the crowd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i learn a new german phrase: ganz berlin ha&szlig;t die polizei</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i feel a jolt of fear</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>am i in danger?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>am i ever not?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>another chant: you are not alone. you are not alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my friend darts instantly into the action, phone in hand videotaping</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i lose them in the crowd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my awareness heightens</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after awhile i find my friend again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>they sheepishly apologize for feeding me mushrooms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;i forgot this was kind of a demo&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;it&rsquo;s ok, i&rsquo;m american, at least we aren&rsquo;t being kettled or tear gassed yet.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the officers pull back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we continue marching, now with the vague sense of foreboding hovering over us</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>marching along, hearing katy perry on the speaker truck several blocks ahead of us as the party portion of the march continues, seemingly unaware of what is happening in the rear of the march</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we look over our shoulders, the pincer descends again, i repeat my new german phrase</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what will happen if i, an american transsexual, am arrested in a foreign country?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am not alone&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am not alone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in front of us a party</p>
<p>behind us a riot</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those days where the dream&rsquo;s residue hasn&rsquo;t quite washed off.</p>
<p>I am strolling through the city periodically interrupted by associations for which the primary memory is lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was I someone else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We speak in order to ratify exchanges made while dreaming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We came from a place where there is no me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where does the player character end? And the interface begin?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am non player non character</p>
<p>How do I touch the animating mechanics of whatever game I find myself playing</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>stay alive.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the game is usually uneventful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a few times a day i get called boss, bro, buddy, even sir on occasion</p>
<p>who cares&nbsp;</p>
<p>and in equal measure a stranger tells me they love my style</p>
<p>or my tattoos</p>
<p>whatever</p>
<p>an oblique way of complimenting my body</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i get photographed while strolling through soho&nbsp;</p>
<p>on the way home from the New Museum office in Tribeca</p>
<p>he says i look great</p>
<p>i say i did not consent</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no matter where I am, no matter how I look, whenever I leave the house, a program runs in the background&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i sit on the subway rehearsing my lines</p>
<p>for my inevitable encounter with the nameless faceless malice of every horror story I&rsquo;ve heard from other transfemmes in my community</p>
<p>i practice my explosive animal fury&nbsp;</p>
<p>back the FUCK up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not afraid of you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this line of thinking is not without consequences</p>
<p>the hair on my neck stands up</p>
<p>my cheeks flush</p>
<p>i am recreationally dosing cortisol</p>
<p>and then i remember</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i can radiate pure love</p>
<p> </p>
<p>have you ever met a trans person before?</p>
<p>hi, i&rsquo;m sammie</p>
<p>seems like you&rsquo;re holding a lot of anger</p>
<p>that seems painful</p>
<p>do you have any questions for me? while i&rsquo;m here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>this may be your only chance to ask them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>where did you learn about us?</p>
<p>oh honey you watch too much tv.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and then of course the moment arrives</p>
<p>I enter the station and ask the attendant a question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am wearing a blue linen dress which flows past my ankles. a blue crew neck sweatshirt. a blue head scarf. A black flowered cloth mask.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>skin completely covered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my voice gives me away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a man follows me down the stairs to the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>it is empty except for an elderly woman who acknowledges neither of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;i thought you were attractive&rdquo; he says</p>
<p>at first i dont realize he&rsquo;s talking to me</p>
<p>i sit motionless and silent on a bench</p>
<p>vaping under my mask</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s standing over my left shoulder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you a faggot. you a faggot. you a faggot. you a faggot. you a faggot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>over and over again</p>
<p>i do not acknowledge him. I stare straight ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>he goes away for awhile</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t dare look back</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s over my shoulder again</p>
<p>&ldquo;hey mama where you stay at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when he turns his back, i dart behind a pillar. i crouch and peek around the corner to see if he&rsquo;s still there. he&rsquo;s confused, looking for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is a stealth mission, Snake</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>stealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i apply the correct social and physical modifications&nbsp;</p>
<p>i can hope to become invisible</p>
<p>To be read, as a result and not a process.</p>
<p>you survived this stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you are permitted to continue suffering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you did not pass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the place you are looking for does not exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>he gets on his train and I cry on mine</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t move to New York like I planned</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t get into New Inc like I thought I would.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said once that the avatar is more like clothes than a body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what about clothes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What type of girl uses this computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Misgendered by the italian photographer I repeat my staircase wit &lsquo;sono una donna&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to my precious metaphor about the feminized invisible labor of preservation if you don&rsquo;t read me as a woman?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am tired of stunting.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I get 15000 steps a day exclusively in platforms</p>
<p>Rocking a casual 6&rsquo;5&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I cannot hope to be read the way I see myself,</p>
<p>I can at least be intimidating</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>I think of the way a certain kind of male colleague stares through me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standing in a circle at an opening, attempting to contribute to a conversation.</p>
<p>Being so roundly ignored that I wonder for a moment whether I still exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sympathetic glance from a friend as I drift elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am a mouth</p>
<p>I am a sensing organ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am tired of pleading with men&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make things with technology</p>
<p>Or to fund urgent work&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am tired of dancing in the negative mirror</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shoehorning an idea into a legible container for whoever is holding the key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a fucking bar tab to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I was cis and looked the way I do, would you speak to me differently?&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so stupid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Am I really going to come up here and talk about fucking micro aggressions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a fucking genocide?&nbsp;</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>OF COURSE the gender binary is fake&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of COURSE there is no self!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please just tell me I&rsquo;m not crazy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I be read for the softness I feel inside?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It circles and rises. Easy to spot, hard to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeping in like water, sloshing through locks and dams into peripheral vision and involuntary vocalization. Dysphoria the unnameable, euphoria the uncountable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refracted on platonic solids are disembodied fragments of a portrait that rang. Mom's pearls and my first tattoos: an anchor and a garbled DNR in morse code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My new voice, hidden among the protean angles, no longer probes but inhabits a register.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing myself in glittering fragments which slowly move into my awareness as if from nowhere and retreat. The broken manifold becomes more continuous. Searching in the angles, points of light project widening gradients until the edges intersect. Yes, I am starting to see a face in there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My secret vocal training in sighs and particles. His bedroom voice is mine everywhere. You can either cut the cord or choose not to use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking in tongues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mouthed the words of our favorite song.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize his absence more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>all now in time, we walk, you are, somewhere, something, now, and always.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>toward</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The title of this series is an olive branch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An invitation to occupy a convenient fiction with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tis but thy name that is my enemy:</p>
<p>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot</p>
<p>Nor arm nor face nor any other part</p>
<p>Belonging to a man. O be some other name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of many idioms instantiated in English language canon by Shakespeare, it draws into relief the disjunction between sign and signifier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James Joyce returned to the phrase in Ulysses &ndash; Bloom turns the phrase over to himself throughout the novel, in relation to his sense of exile from the Irish Nation. Bloom was a Hungarian Jew, his surname was a translation of Virag, the Hungarian word for flower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Molly&rsquo;s famous yes, Joyce signs the novel with three words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zurich</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trieste</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ulysses takes place over a single day, and my husband told me that you can walk the entire path taken by the Bloom and Dedalus, that the distances are that perfectly inscribed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joyce wrote this quintessential Irish novel in exile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was building a synthesizer in a hacker space in oakland called the sudo room, which is located in a collective of collectives called omni commons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I met a guy named Don who was always hacking on javascript projects. We would chat lightly about music while we worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up moving home to LA and a few months later I saw an online exhibition curated by an old schoolmate of mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget how it felt to show up to this website and see a bunch of text scrolling up the left side of the page, a 3d space with a bunch of green diamonds moving around, I jog my mouse, wait&hellip; I can look around. I touch an arrow key, I can move!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait&hellip;&hellip; those diamonds are PEOPLE!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look up the platform, newart.city, and see that it&rsquo;s led by that guy, D0n.xyz!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I email him right away asking how far along he is with the project, whether he needs any nontechnical community support help. He does, I join, and my life changes forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>For the past four years, I have been a human interface between artists and the underlying technology of new art city: a nexus between the dream and the possible. I know the boundaries, and I can ask the boys to push them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good boys, I love them so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so for the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve been using New Art City as a performance tool, gradually learning javascript by hacking my spaces with the scripting window. Over time I started playing with things like p5 and hydra, which have been amazing tools for learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blessed beyond measure to call the creators of both of these tools friends, as a result of my work at New Art City.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This summer, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time trying to learn how to make software myself. The tool I&rsquo;m using today is by far the most complex piece of software I&rsquo;ve ever built.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>I am leaving Oakland, driving back to Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking for a coffee and a bathroom before I go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I happen upon this cafe near Grand Lake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hand written chalk menus crowded with words. Drab yellow paint with crimson moulding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undesigned, in a way that indicates its longevity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No light wood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No hostile danish furniture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No 10,000 dollar espresso machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a pot of diner coffee sitting on a hot plate, above it hangs a sign that says &lsquo;complimentary coffee.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An older man stands&nbsp; behind the counter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tell, I don&rsquo;t want anything else, and ask if I can pay him for the coffee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He looks at me like I&rsquo;m crazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rsquo;It&rsquo;s free,&rsquo; he says, with a bemused smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coffee is so hot in the styrofoam cup. Only powdered creamer, which I forego.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No lids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I burn my mouth ten times and nearly spill it on myself as I get on the highway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I hear that sound again</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p>we walk along an empty road, past a grand country estate which seems hundreds of years old</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we are running through waist high grass</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the full moon rises and we take a moment to appreciate the moonshadows over the grassland</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we enter a hole in a fence, the moon splinters through the tree canopy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is no adjusting. no distinction between branch and apparition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hand in hand in hand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we trust we are on a trail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if only because the way is not obstructed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we hallucinate light shining through breaks in the canopy as puddles&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we bury our feet ankle deep in real pits of mud</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a tiny pulsing green glow on the forest floor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i ask if i am imagining it, no, we are seeing the same sleeping firefly&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>owls hoot in the distance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>branches crack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we are not alone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a low hum becomes an encompassing roar above us and we shriek, squeezing hands and pulling close together</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it slowly dissipates and we heave a sigh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we sense steep elevation changes on either side, and struggle not to lose footing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we find ourselves babbling to assure one another of our presence</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we fall silent again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes, that puddle is a reflection, i can see the mirrored movement of the trees above</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i step in one</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>they lose a shoe in the mud</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i feel the blackberry bramble snag my pantleg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we reach a clearing and see the moon again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and scramble up a hill laughing in elation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we reach the road again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is the road we came in on</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p>i am wearing my pink camo pants and jelly platforms with frilly socks, a mesh bra and open silk button up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i sit in my friend&rsquo;s kitchen drinking coffee which they prepare like gong fu cha and serve in tiny cups</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>offhandedly they offer me a homemade mushroom chocolate from their freezer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i take one</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we stroll through neukolln, a bit late from chatting</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i see the police before i see the march</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>riot gear, but helmets held at their sides</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i remark about cryptic humor of the officer in a full face of makeup and white gel claws</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we fall in with the palestine block</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we march, we chant, i feel the familiar comfort of being a voice in a crowd. we chant in german, in english, in arabic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we laugh and count the shirtless men in their windows looking down at us</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the mushrooms are starting to hit, i smile feeling the warmth rising from my abdomen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i feel the familiar joy of strolling along in a sea of dykes as far as i can see</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we see police impotently holding cameras on poles, which demonstrators deftly block with banners and keffiyehs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>surrounded by adorable lace clad apple cheeked 24 year olds holding signs and drinking radlers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>before i know it, the police have their helmets on. they descend in pincer columns, grabbing a few protesters and pulling them out of the crowd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i learn a new german phrase: ganz berlin ha&szlig;t die polizei</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i feel a jolt of fear</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>am i in danger?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>am i ever not?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>another chant: you are not alone. you are not alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my friend darts instantly into the action, phone in hand videotaping</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i lose them in the crowd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my awareness heightens</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after awhile i find my friend again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>they sheepishly apologize for feeding me mushrooms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;i forgot this was kind of a demo&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;it&rsquo;s ok, i&rsquo;m american, at least we aren&rsquo;t being kettled or tear gassed yet.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the officers pull back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we continue marching, now with the vague sense of foreboding hovering over us</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>marching along, hearing katy perry on the speaker truck several blocks ahead of us as the party portion of the march continues, seemingly unaware of what is happening in the rear of the march</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we look over our shoulders, the pincer descends again, i repeat my new german phrase</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what will happen if i, an american transsexual, am arrested in a foreign country?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am not alone&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am not alone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in front of us a party</p>
<p>behind us a riot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we accidentally march too far ahead of our bloc and we find ourselves in the zionist terf bloc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>jesus fucking christ</p>

    <p>What do you see when you think of an archive?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What happens inside of it?</p>
    <p>And who gets to access it?</p>
    <p>For what purpose?</p>
    <p>When I think archive, I see a brick fortress. Static, separate from the present.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I know this to be an illusion.</p>
    <p>When I encounter archives in real life, my impression is quite the opposite. Stewardship as I understand it is an active process. New media artifacts are expected to mutate if they wish to stay alive.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I know a bit about mutation for the purposes of survival.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you wake up with a man&rsquo;s memories, embodied and digital, and you must justify your possession of them.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sometimes you find yourself with a collection before you know what to do with it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This has been my experience.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I encode the act of remembrance, because I want you to remember this.</p>
    <p>my greatest challenge as a new media artist is the &lsquo;whoa&rsquo; factor</p>
    <p>it is not difficult to use a computer to elicit a &lsquo;whoa!&rsquo;</p>
    <p>what concerns me is what comes after.</p>
    <p>all media is time based.</p>
    <p>time is the frontier along which experience proliferates.</p>
    <p>as soon as information became widely transmissible,</p>
    <p>we entered the age of simulation.</p>
    <p>as the simulation dilates,</p>
    <p>the window of sensation narrows</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I want you to think about me tomorrow.</p>
    <p>I perform for the paucity of words and the density of presence</p>
    <p>I said once that information is not memory</p>
    <p>Not even memory is memory.</p>
    <p>The two must exist together.</p>
    <p>information can never be presence</p>
    <p>the presence is the listening.</p>
    <p>an active and embodied process.</p>
    <p>networks transmit presence</p>
    <p>but solidarity is not encoded</p>
    <p>in the networks that carry it</p>
    <p>society demands the unceasing production of documented miracles</p>
    <p>we faithfully oblige</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been summoned many times to perform expertise about VR, especially during our purported transition into the so called metaverse. In part, this performance was an act of resistance. I would rather talk about death than VR.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I love to die.</p>
    <p>I love it so much.</p>
    <p>The tower rewards with regeneration.</p>
    <p>I think of the places I&rsquo;ve called home.</p>
    <p>And the ones I&rsquo;ve been ready to depart at a moments notice.</p>
    <p>While my husband, Tvordis, decorated his perfect Chicago loft in an old soda pop factory with matching mid century modern furniture, I was preparing for a reality where I could leave the country tomorrow with a Pelican case and a backpack.</p>
    <p>I didn&rsquo;t want to leave.</p>
    <p>But I wanted to die.</p>
    <p>I think of home computers.</p>
    <p>The computers I&rsquo;ve called home.</p>
    <p>And the ones I&rsquo;ve been ready to depart at a moments notice.</p>
    <p>My husband&rsquo;s computer, Theseus, is a lived-in laptop.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Almost 15 years old and still works. We stopped updating the OS around 2018.</p>
    <p>Three motherboard replacements, two batteries, optical drive long since replaced with an auxiliary hard drive bay. Maxxed RAM. Rehoused in an entirely different case. Tvordis was so proud of it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s 2017.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He sits in that loft with Theseus, generating poetry using the latest open source neural networks (Tensorflow and Keras) which he trained on Finnegans Wake, his favorite book. These models took hours to train and their outputs were clumsy, exposing the edges of the algorithm. He didn&rsquo;t quite know why he was doing this, except that he felt he needed to. He felt like he was surrounded by a chorus of angels, sitting for hours at his computer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Three years later, he was dead.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A wave of open source neural networks promised a new age of computing. It was possible to train a model on his personal computer. Seven years later, so called AI is ubiquitous &ndash; computer vision, machine learning, and the datacenters that underly it are distant and invisible. The cloud joins the local machine as a passthrough for these atemporal intimacies. The automated witness aggregates the intimacies of the world.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>An indelible impression becomes a confluence of memories worn through with rewritings, residing in the body and scattered across globally distributed hard drives. Alone with his computer, I performed the poems by clicking and dragging through them as a single line of text.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This was not the beginning of my life as an artist, but it was a beginning.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I think of the body I called home.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>And the body I was ready to depart at a moments notice.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m leaving the country next month with a Pelican case and a backpack.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A memory returns as I think of somebody else.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>My memory's camera hovers just to the left of my head. I on my back and you somehow inclined over me.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I can see my own face in the right periphery of the vision. You are faceless, headless.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I only sense your hands.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your body forms a vague greygreen shadow, like a reflection through the side of a panel of glass.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It lasts one of those dense eternal seconds&nbsp; in fantasy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Which will certainly replay like an unstageable film for several weeks.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I know already it must have been my room, and it would not be the last time we laid together.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The bed must have been languorously deep and soft. The ghostly blue light at midnight after our eyes adjust.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We must have already been talking only as gravely as first loves can&nbsp;</p>
    <p>for many hours already.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>My body was still blank but my residual self-image no longer reproduces it this way.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I might never be satisfied with the word I choose to describe the way you touched my chest, palms open, eyes closed, begging yourself not to forget me.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I am a grown man reinhabiting my younger mind and our threadbare memory&nbsp;</p>
    <p>but not my body.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If I strain I can bring the feeling of your hands on my hairless chest into focus. I cannot square the image with its sensation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As I think of conjuring her body in my mind at an instant I cascade through ten more darkened hallways I may never retrieve.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I flipped the record and God Only Knows played</p>
    <p>I hardly paid attention to the song</p>
    <p>I rested my head in her lap and I felt a tear drop onto my temple</p>
    <p>and diffuse through the fine pigmentless hairs</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>she asked me what it feels like to be in love</p>
    <p>I paused for a long moment and said</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>'This.'&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
    <h2>HOW WOULD YOU HEAR ME</h2>
    <p>Lately Dead Name feels like a diary. Serialized missives pertaining to my manifold confusion.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The project turns 2 in October.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I wonder if I&rsquo;m really just writing the same essay over and over again for different audiences.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve presented Dead Name everywhere from poetry readings to art and tech festivals, but this is my first time sharing this piece in a space manifestly dedicated to <em>games</em>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What is the difference between an agent and an avatar?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I am told Avatars are distinguished from agents by the element of control: Avatars are controlled by humans, whereas agents are controlled by computer algorithms. Hence, interaction with an avatar qualifies as computer-mediated communication, whereas interaction with an agent qualifies as human&ndash;computer interaction.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This research is produced in the context of compliance.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>How do people react to a system when they believe they are experiencing mediated communication, and not human computer interaction?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>How would you talk to a computer if she was passing?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I often think of myself like an NPC. An anthropomorphic interface between people and the mechanics of New Art City: the video game where you install real art.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This NPC is represented by Miss Sammie, my avatar.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Frankly, she doesn&rsquo;t get much use lately.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Or, she represents a period in my life when my (and our) embodiment was exceedingly virtual. When I was more often a two dimensional figure on your computer screen, or better yet a chipper voice in a community discord. An email toned with casual and effusive affirmation, a foil to your staid and professional proposal.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>People came to New Art City expecting either a startup or an arts institution. What a privilege to deliver neither.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Come inside, have a seat.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>When you think of an avatar, what shape does it take? Where is it allowed to exist?</p>
    <p>Is it separate from you? A part of you? Is it clothes? A body? <em>Your</em> body?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I forget.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Anyway, we met and exchanged bodies.</p>
    <p>Or he slipped out as I entered.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
    <p>We were together there for a long moment before it got quiet again.</p>
    <p>I promised I would remember.</p>
    <p>We wrote what we called a question in the form of a book. It was more like a rat&rsquo;s nest of dramatic assertions in the form of a hypertext.</p>
    <p>People have seen it, read it, and contributed to it.</p>
    <p>But I removed it from the internet.</p>

    <p>I place my awareness two inches in front of my forehead, crossfading cacophony and absolute stillness.</p>

    <p>Dead Name is a speculative archive in which I play the female archivist of the dead male artist: my late husband, Tvordis Veeler. As the title may indicate, this death is not a traditional death. With this fiction revealed, the significance of his computer&rsquo;s name should also come into focus.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This practice unites my individual experience of grief mediated by technology with broader grief <em>over</em> technology itself. When I perform, I deliver lectures wrapped in eulogies, walking through a virtual space projected behind me.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m accompanied by a rising chorus of dead Sammies, who interrupt and contradict me, but also automate the labor of my performance of expertise. When I am invited to give a talk without an honorarium, I perform with pre recorded repertoire.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The spatial archives where I perform are available online for anyone to visit, and each lecture is published on a dedicated website.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This archive is a moving process which structures the media collection inherited from my husband, defines a process for incorporating new artifacts, and curates public presentations from the collection. The boundaries between documentation and art are blurry. Indeed, the identity of the steward is inconsistent. The retrieval methods are varied and multisensory. It revels in its incompleteness.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Shortly after Tvordis passed, Theseus died too. Stewardship of the machine-memory was thrust onto me. I was terrified. His mother had an old computer from the same year, which she volunteered as a surrogate for Theseus&rsquo;s guts. I transferred the working parts and modifications from Theseus to his mom&rsquo;s computer, continuing the cycle of dispersal and reincorporation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>That hard drive works by holding electrons in place, which aren&rsquo;t freed until the files are deleted. The hard drive is already past its recommended usage period and will inevitably fail. In order to preserve the data, I need to clone the startup disk and replace it with a new drive, thus releasing his traces from the machine.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s the difference between accessing a copy and an original?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s fiction, but it&rsquo;s not an act.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I encountered the term &ldquo;prosthetic memory&rdquo; in the early research for this book. It was coined in 2004 by Allison Landsberg in her book of the same name. Landsberg argues that &ldquo;modernity makes possible and necessary a new form of public cultural memory.&rdquo; Prosthetic memory &ldquo;emerges at the interface between a person and a historical narrative about the past.&rdquo; The subject &ldquo;does not simply apprehend a historical narrative but takes on a more personal, deeply felt memory of a past event through which he or she did not live.&rdquo; She views this as a phenomenon of significant political force, which has the power to shape collective conceptions of history and mythmaking.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>She contends that these technologies of memory blur the boundaries between individual and collective experience, allowing individuals to &ldquo;suture&rdquo; themselves into larger histories, to identify with memories which are not their own. In her construction, it seems there is no memory but public memory. Mass media renders us infinitely porous to exogenous experience, yet our private memories remain forever private.</p>
    <p>This is quite relevant to the predicament I find myself in.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sutured into a body that came with a complete set of memories.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A plural experience mediated through an individual container.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Three years later, Jose Van Dijck published Mediated Memories in the Digital Age, in which she argues that media and memory are mutually constituted. Mediated memory objects are sites where individual minds and collective cultures meet. I find this more comforting.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Tvordis and I access the files in his computer from opposite sides of a temporal mirror. We are consubstantiated through Theseus.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Each time it freezes, I begin again.</p>
    <p>Over and over.</p>
    <p>I fall through the street.</p>
    <p>Jagged polygons shoot out of my body mesh.</p>
    <p>Completing the training mission as the game collapses around me.</p>
    <p>Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Grand Theft Auto, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
    <p>fuck.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m having the bardo dream again.</p>
    <p>Today I am James. Standing at the mirror in a filthy public restroom.</p>
    <p>I go to the car. I find the map. I descend the stairs. I walk into the foggy forest. I reach the gate.</p>
    <p>I am at the mirror again.</p>
    <p>I deviate from the program. I walk up the road until I tell myself, yet once more, that this is the road I came in on, and that there is no use going back.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill&hellip;&rdquo; Mary repeats in sotto voce.</p>
    <p>Always looking for a girl.</p>
    <p>He was looking for me.</p>
    <p>And then for an instant I clipped through him.</p>
    <p>Or was it him through me?</p>
    <p>I forget.</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <h2><strong>GYRE</strong></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s one of those days where the dream&rsquo;s residue hasn&rsquo;t quite washed off.</p>
    <p>I am strolling through the city periodically interrupted by associations for which the primary memory is lost.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Was I someone else?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We speak in order to ratify exchanges made while dreaming.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We came from a place where there is no me.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Where does the player character end? And the interface begin?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> I am non player non character</p>
    <p>How do I touch the animating mechanics of whatever game I find myself playing</p>
    <p><br /><br /><br /></p>
    <p><em>stay alive.&nbsp;</em></p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>the game is usually uneventful.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>a few times a day i get called boss, bro, buddy, even sir on occasion</p>
    <p>who cares&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and in equal measure a stranger tells me they love my style</p>
    <p>or my tattoos</p>
    <p>whatever</p>
    <p>an oblique way of complimenting my body</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>i get photographed while strolling through soho&nbsp;</p>
    <p>on the way home from the New Museum office in Tribeca</p>
    <p>he says i look great</p>
    <p>i say i did not consent</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>no matter where I am, no matter how I look, whenever I leave the house, a program runs in the background&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>i sit on the subway rehearsing my lines</p>
    <p>for my inevitable encounter with the nameless faceless malice of every horror story I&rsquo;ve heard from other transfemmes in my community</p>
  
    <p>i practice my explosive animal fury&nbsp;</p>
    <p>back the FUCK up.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>i&rsquo;m not afraid of you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>this line of thinking is not without consequences</p>
    <p>the hair on my neck stands up</p>
    <p>my cheeks flush</p>
    <p>i am recreationally dosing cortisol</p>
    <p>and then i remember</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>i can radiate pure love</em></p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>have you ever met a trans person before?</p>
    <p>hi, i&rsquo;m sammie</p>
    <p>seems like you&rsquo;re holding a lot of anger</p>
    <p>that seems painful</p>
    <p>do you have any questions for me? while i&rsquo;m here?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>this may be your only chance to ask them.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>where did you learn about us?</p>
    <p>oh honey you watch too much tv.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>and then of course the moment arrives</p>
    <p>I enter the station and ask the attendant a question.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>i am wearing a blue linen dress which flows past my ankles. a blue crew neck sweatshirt. a blue head scarf. A black flowered cloth mask.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>skin completely covered.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>my voice gives me away.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>a man follows me down the stairs to the platform.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>it is empty except for an elderly woman who acknowledges neither of us.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i thought you were <em>attractive&rdquo; </em>he says</p>
    <p>at first i dont realize he&rsquo;s talking to me</p>
    <p>i sit motionless and silent on a bench</p>
    <p>vaping under my mask</p>
    <p>he&rsquo;s standing over my left shoulder.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;you a faggot. you a faggot. you a faggot. you a faggot. you a faggot.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>over and over again</p>
    <p>i do not acknowledge him. I stare straight ahead.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>he goes away for awhile</p>
    <p>i don&rsquo;t dare look back</p>
    <p>he&rsquo;s over my shoulder again</p>
    <p>&ldquo;hey mama where you stay at?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>when he turns his back, i dart behind a pillar. i crouch and peek around the corner to see if he&rsquo;s still there. he&rsquo;s confused, looking for me.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>this is a stealth mission, Snake</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><i>stealth.</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>if i apply the correct social and physical modifications&nbsp;</p>
    <p>i can hope to become invisible</p>
    <p>To be read, as a result and not a process.</p>
    <p>you survived this stage.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you are permitted to continue suffering.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But you did not pass.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>the place you are looking for does not exist.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>he gets on his train and I cry on mine</p>
    <p>and I don&rsquo;t move to New York like I planned</p>
    <p>and I don&rsquo;t get into New Inc like I thought I would.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I said once that the avatar is more like clothes than a body.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But what about clothes?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What type of girl uses this computer?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Misgendered by the italian photographer I repeat my staircase wit &lsquo;sono una donna&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What happens to my precious metaphor about the feminized invisible labor of preservation if you don&rsquo;t read me as a woman?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I am tired of stunting.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>I get 15000 steps a day exclusively in platforms</p>
    <p>Rocking a casual 6&rsquo;5&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If I cannot hope to be read the way I see myself,</p>
    <p>I can at least be intimidating</p>
    <p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
    <p>I think of the way a certain kind of male colleague stares through me.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Standing in a circle at an opening, attempting to contribute to a conversation.</p>
    <p>Being so roundly ignored that I wonder for a moment whether I still exist.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A sympathetic glance from a friend as I drift elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;I am a mouth</p>
    <p>I am a sensing organ</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I am tired of pleading with men&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To make things with technology</p>
    <p>Or to fund urgent work&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I am tired of dancing in the negative mirror</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Shoehorning an idea into a legible container for whoever is holding the key.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This is a fucking bar tab to you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If I was cis and looked the way I do, would you speak to me differently?&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s so stupid.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /><br /></p>
    <p>Am I really going to come up here and talk about fucking micro aggressions?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>During a fucking genocide?&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /><br /></p>
    <p>OF COURSE the gender binary is fake&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Of COURSE there is no self!&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Please just tell me I&rsquo;m not crazy.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>How can I be read for the softness I feel inside?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It circles and rises. Easy to spot, hard to see.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Seeping in like water, sloshing through locks and dams into peripheral vision and involuntary vocalization. Dysphoria the unnameable, euphoria the uncountable.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Refracted on platonic solids are disembodied fragments of a portrait that rang. Mom's pearls and my first tattoos: an anchor and a garbled DNR in morse code.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>My new voice, hidden among the protean angles, no longer probes but inhabits a register.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Seeing myself in glittering fragments which slowly move into my awareness as if from nowhere and retreat. The broken manifold becomes more continuous. Searching in the angles, points of light project widening gradients until the edges intersect. Yes, I am starting to see a face in there.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>My secret vocal training in sighs and particles. His bedroom voice is mine everywhere. You can either cut the cord or choose not to use it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I'm thinking in tongues</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I remember everything.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I mouthed the words of our favorite song.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I realize his absence more.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>all now in time, we walk, you are, somewhere, something, now, and always.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I dream of computing that feels like</p>
    <p>augmented presence&nbsp;</p>
    <p>cultivated through generations of loving care</p>
    <p>A networked unfolding in the fullness of time</p>
    <p>A dilating interconnection&nbsp;</p>
    <p>on our long stroll back to totality</p>
    <p>programs like recipes</p>
    <p>code like carrots</p>
    <p>And hardware like wood</p>
    <p>Wet</p>
    <p>Messy</p>
    <p>Alive</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>That was the last section of the 9th iteration of my ongoing performance project called <em>Dead Name.</em> I&rsquo;ve been doing this for over a year now. Each performance is site specific and I write a new essay each time I perform. I like to bring this to places where &ldquo;artist talks&rdquo; or &ldquo;lectures&rdquo; are expected, places like conferences are great because the expectation and the reality differ so dramatically. Each time I&rsquo;m kind of performing a corridor of Sammie, some more fictional than others. So today I&rsquo;m kind of &ldquo;doing Dead Name&rdquo; as an artist talk, but I&rsquo;m also kind of performing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>Dead Name is a spatial archive of each performance in the series. I&rsquo;m obsessed with archives as ways to both bridge time and produce history. Every performance is recorded, and then I install each section in the places where I stopped to speak, so when I perform, time folds back on itself in some weird ways that I like to observe and document. With these voiceovers, I&rsquo;m accompanied by a rising chorus of dead Sammies, who automate the labor of my performance of expertise.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The site of a lot of my work is an ongoing grief ritual over my late husband, Tvordis. This practice unites my individual experience of grief mediated by technology with broader grief <em>over </em>technology itself. His death formed an immutable rupture between before and after, and our life together is the well of inspiration that drives me today.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The unit of analysis of this practice is the word. Tvordis once told me that &ldquo;words are rocks.&rdquo; I have to keep reflecting on what this means to me, and whether that meaning has shifted. I think the gist is that people make meaning. Words are inert until translated in the mind <em>and heart</em> of a living subject.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We fell in love through text messages and when we finally got in bed together I whispered &ldquo;I left my phone for you.&rdquo; He was word before he was flesh. Now he is word again.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We met while studying political theory at the University of Chicago. We were both obsessed with historical revolutions and transitional justice. Political theory is what you study when you have no idea what you want to be, but these concerns ended up being really relevant to my practice today. He ended up working in tech but neither of us had any sincere passion for computers. We loved meeting people online and trying on virtual identities like clothes. Going to the last remaining &ldquo;Mos Eisley Cantinas of the Internet&rdquo; as he called them.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>My obsession with technology and the history of computing came after he died. When he left, the only remnants I had were his clothes and his laptop. We devised a ritual of remembrance with that computer which I still practice on and off screen. Through the act of remembrance, I try to speak to the ways we as a collective produce memory.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I love broken technology.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I trust friction. The more seamless the onboarding process, the more I feel I&rsquo;m being tricked.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I want to see the edges of the algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I want to see where it breaks down.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of the best moments I&rsquo;ve had with virtual reality was recently, when I tried to connect my headset to my PC over a bad wifi connection. The viewport started to glitch and the screen was overtaken by triangles of gray and white terminating at a point in the center of my field of vision. The edges of the triangles became more jagged and a tiny red line one pixel wide ran through the middle.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For 20 minutes or so I just sat and watched this phenomenon because I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d ever be able to reproduce the bug.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Totally present.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So embodied.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>And then my battery died.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
    <p>So fundamentally my work as an artist is a type of political rhetoric that connects my production of my individual history with our collective construction of reality online. I aim to draw junctions between local and global phenomena of networked life. Two specific junctions of interest are poetry with revolution, and history with technology. These all relate to the ways we construct our individual and collective realities.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What do words have to do with revolutions?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Both are consensus mechanisms which are a cause and result of collective understanding. Which do not exist absent human intervention.</p>
    <p>The word revolution also interests me because so often it&rsquo;s used to market consumer technology.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Repeat after me, no consumer product can ever be revolutionary.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I dream of a future that we make, not one that we buy. Definitely not one that is built for us. One more VR story. A close friend of mine, eminent digital anthropologist Wade Wallerstein called up VRChat during the height of the pandemic and said, rightly, that they should hire him because they have no anthropologists on staff and he is one of the leading experts on their virtual worlds. VRChat said &ldquo;sorry, we&rsquo;re basically only hiring engineers right now.&rdquo; We can&rsquo;t think about why we&rsquo;re building it, we have to build it!! </p>
    <p>We are experiencing a generational shift in human culture from the material to the metaphysical. We have been doing technology the way we did mechanized industry, and the two are not compatible. </p>
    <p>Herbie Hancock summarizes this shift in his song, <em>Wisdom</em>, on the album Future 2 Future.</p>
    <p>The speaker says:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Knowledge corresponds to the past. It is technology. Wisdom is the future. It is philosophy. It is people&rsquo;s hearts that move the age. While knowledge may provide a useful point of reference, it cannot become a force to guide the future. By contrast, wisdom captivates people&rsquo;s hearts and has the power to open a new age. Wisdom is the key to understanding the age, creating the time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Poetry doesn&rsquo;t happen on the page and no revolution can be captured on camera. Poetry and revolutions happen in the mind. I view both as signifiers overswelling their containers. Where the poem is instant and ephemeral, the revolution unfolds on a generational timescale.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Technology is often viewed as something that happens to us, not something we make. The same goes for history. There&rsquo;s an illusion that these two things take an objective shape.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A David Graeber quote that always sticks with me is, 'The ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p>This is where the connection between my studio practice and my work as an organizer at New Art City starts to emerge. I found myself working in <em>virtual </em>reality somewhat by accident. I avoid the term VR, because it tends to refer more to features than feelings. The sticky thing about virtual reality for me is the <em>reality </em>part.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Are reality and realism the same thing?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Will more pixels make the world in my headset more real?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Is reality what we see, or what we believe?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of my biggest problems with the so called metaverse was the idea that somehow making a 3D simulation would produce different social relations online, but that&rsquo;s never how social relations form, with a bunch of consultants in a room saying you will buy Gucci sneakers for your avatar. I think this also draws focus away from the nature of the simulation we already live in.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Language itself is a simulated reality. Technologies like the printing press, the radio and of course the internet extend the scope of the simulation media, but it was as real in 1700 as it is today.</p>
    <p>Over time, however, the simulation world has extended to such a degree that the boundaries are a lot harder to see.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s easier to log on than it is to log off&ndash; our default state is connected. The simulation is synchronous and interactive, but the rules are different than they are in the physical world. So my conceptual concern has more to do with examining the simulation we already live in, and the human bonds of solidarity that truly bind us.</p>
    <p>So that was a speedrun of my manifold confusion, now I can talk about how some of these things are put into practice at New Art City.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>New Art City is an artist run virtual space founded in March of 2020 which allows artists to build 3D multiplayer websites without code. Artists can upload images, audio, video, and 3D shapes to a simple drag and drop editor, and host openings where everyone is experiencing the art together. We&rsquo;ve hosted nearly 200 shows featuring around 6000 artists, and we&rsquo;ve had something like half a million visitors.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re made of essentially the same things as a startup: an LLC, some code, some people, but we just chose not to operate that way. If we rebranded to a &ldquo;metaverse platform&rdquo; in 2021, we could have probably gotten some money from a venture capital fund, but it didn&rsquo;t accord with our values. We instead tried to act more like a born digital arts institution. A DIY warehouse with infinite studios.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Access is at the center of our mission and accessibility is intersectional. It is not a problem to be solved, it is an active and political orientation. Geography, digital device, technical literacy, race, and disability all contribute to excluding folks from showing and experiencing art. 50% of internet users on earth primarily access the internet through a mobile device. 2% own a headset. We chose to build for the 50%, not the 2%. We want to make virtual exhibitions easy to author and we want to make them available to the widest audience possible.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Access is more than accessibility. It&rsquo;s not about who you allow to enter, it&rsquo;s about who you invite. This means that we actively encourage participation and collaboration with under-represented artists, and those artists help us determine our priorities as an institution.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve been a crossroads of a ton of different types of artists: students, educators, museums, and artists who show in them, and we remain the only space that came up in that era which is solely dedicated to artists. So we are really close to our core &ldquo;users&rdquo; because they&rsquo;re more than users, they&rsquo;re colleagues, collaborators, and friends.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The reason the metaverse failed was A) the consultants got bored and moved on to AI and B) they tried to market a product as a compendium of features. It is a solution to an imaginary problem. We operate New Art City in exactly the opposite way. We build slowly because almost everything we build is a result of communication and collaboration with the artists we serve.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /><br /></p>
    <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
    <p><strong>Alt Text</strong></p>
    <p>We are the first virtual gallery to include alt text as a metadata field, which is good and important for our friends who use screen readers, but alt text isn&rsquo;t accessibility, it&rsquo;s just a tool. Infrastructure is tool + culture. The tool is only as useful as how you use it and who you invite to use it. Early on we convened an accessibility panel of artists working in different accessibility fields, who held us accountable to our access goals, helped us write a public access statement, and collected accessibility resources which are available on our website.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We didn&rsquo;t make this alt text field for a theoretical blind person, we made it for real people, so we tested the feature with a bunch of blind folks. Their feedback was essentially, &ldquo;this is a well built accessible webpage, but there&rsquo;s a big difference between going to an art show and reading an exhibition catalog.&rdquo; So this inspired us to invite artists to give recorded tours of their exhibitions, with a docent (me) providing visual descriptions while the artists spoke to the work.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This archive of exhibitions with accessible tours and metadata was essentially the prototype of the nonprofit arm we founded this year, which we&rsquo;re calling Virtual Access Lab. I can talk more about that later.</p>
    <p><strong>Captioning</strong></p>
    <p>One of those panel members is Andy Slater, a brilliant blind artist from Chicago who was commissioned to create the first ever non visual virtual experience on New Art City. We built a time coded captioning system for our tool to make Andy&rsquo;s piece, but that is now a built-in feature for all users.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>VR</strong></p>
    <p>We also recently built our first VR implementation for Nat Decker, who was commissioned to create a piece for HTC&rsquo;s Vive headset. They didn&rsquo;t really want to build something to crip wash HTC&rsquo;s metaverse platform, so they built it in New Art City instead. Viverse is built to be navigated with joystick controllers, which are impossible for a lot of people to use for multiple reasons. Nat instead recommended that we develop gaze-based navigation with waypoints and auditory feedback. That also opened the door to waypoints as a platform-wide tool which we&rsquo;ll eventually use to automate guided tours within the gallery.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Virtual Access Lab</strong></p>
    <p>VAL arises out of a synthesis of these experiences. The idea to form an institution was a long process, but the two things we ended up organizing around are access and preservation, which I believe are intertwined.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>New Art City allows artists to export their worlds and self-host them in the event that our servers go offline, or they just want possession of the real files. Data sovereignty is important, but we also want to set a higher standard of stewardship for the art that happens here. Storage is one thing, but preservation encompasses more care and artist intent.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The process of inducting artists into the New Art City archive centers around accessibility through metadata, documentation, and hosting. These are cultural infrastructures more than technical infrastructures. The end goal is to empower artists to give the care of access and preservation to one another, and build a digital civic architecture that supports this aim.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br /><br /><br /></p>
    <p>So we&rsquo;ve come down to earth and touched some grass, but I&rsquo;d like to leave you back in the clouds.</p>
    <p>The art we make today is a gift to an unknown future. It is a promise to exist, and a frontier on which to be held.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Art works are like mushrooms: fruiting bodies of a collective unconscious only incidentally authored by an individual.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We are mycelium.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>a year ago I wrote A Time Capsule Or A Grave:</p>
    <p>the polemic wrapped in a eulogy</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>that would become this performance in progress</p>
    <p>yet once more I wrote an essay when a poem was demanded</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>it feels fitting to begin the second series of this project</p>
    <p>about the excesses of the Silicon Valley ideology</p>
    <p>here in San Francisco</p>
    <p>Which I completed on the same day as</p>
    <p>Marc Andreessen published his &ldquo;Techno-Optimist Manifesto&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>That for which Marc is optimistic makes my heart sink.</p>
    <p>I am not a pessimist, indeed quite the opposite.</p>
    <p>But &nbsp;technology is not the source of my optimism.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>the train has left the station</p>
    <p>nobody is coming to save us</p>
    <p>and so we sing ourselves to sleep</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But we&rsquo;ll never be alone.</p>
    <p>Even when the needle rises from the cosmic record</p>
    <p>And time stops entirely.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>are we living in the end of history?</p>
    <p>is art just entertainment for rich people?</p>
    <p>am I a commodity contemplating itself?</p>
    <p>is representation praxis?</p>
    <p>who decided that there would be a second web?</p>
    <p>who decided that there would be a first one?</p>
    <p>will this consumer product contain the seeds of my liberation?</p>
    <p>do I have to read the Benjamin to make myself understood?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>what is the shape of capital?</p>
    <p>what sound does it make when it accumulates?</p>
    <p>are aesthetics politics?</p>
    <p>are politics aesthetics?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and then I read the Benjamin in a fit of desperation and feel understood myself.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>let me tell you about my late husband, Tvordis Veeler</p>
    <p>This poem is a temporal duet&mdash; his words interposed with mine.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>born sam cortese in hollywood california in 1993</p>
    <p>to parents greg and jocelyn</p>
    <p>a child who spoke to adults hoping beyond hope</p>
    <p>they wouldn&rsquo;t notice that he was five.</p>
    <p>an infectious optimism</p>
    <p>a personal reality distortion field</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>tvordis became tvordis two decades later, on a lark that would ultimately prove fatal.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>he left the body in San Francisco in August 2020, a year after we moved here together.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In my first hour of knowing him, Tvordis taught me that not even death is death.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He didn&rsquo;t die, he lived.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>And he showed me what happens when you turn off the lights.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He had the courage to end his world as he knew it.</p>
    <p>And at that moment, my world began.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>he told me about the gradual unfolding awareness</p>
    <p>that we came from another place and found each other in this one.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>it&rsquo;s not that we didn&rsquo;t choose to be born,</p>
    <p>we just don&rsquo;t remember choosing.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>he always spoke for a future past.</p>
    <p>there was a lapidary quality to his speech</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In our last year, we were inseparable.</p>
    <p>We shared everything.</p>
    <p>and with equal measures of joy and desperation,</p>
    <p>we tried to document as much as we could before he had to go.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>what we made together filled a book and 11 cassette tapes</p>
    <p>when he left, he gave me his personal computer</p>
    <p>and challenged me to &ldquo;examine this archive of a mask in its incompleteness.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To lift these files out of their graves</p>
    <p>and put them places they would never expect to find themselves.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>believing that the things he left behind would be retrieved.</p>
    <p>the dead only exist to the extent that we remember them.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>he&rsquo;s been gone for three years now</p>
    <p>and I still feel like an emissary of his vision.</p>
    <p>it&rsquo;s an interesting shape to carry.</p>
    <p>the female archivist of the dead male artist.</p>
    <p>one of the best ways for a man to increase the market value of his art is to die</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Tvordis was in on the joke.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>so, why am I talking about my dead husband at an arts and technology festival?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I would rather talk about death than VR.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I encode the act of remembrance, because I want you to remember this.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>my greatest challenge as a new media artist is the &lsquo;whoa&rsquo; factor</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>it is not difficult to produce a &lsquo;whoa!&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>what concerns me is what comes after.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>all media is time based.</p>
    <p>time is the frontier along which experience proliferates.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>as soon as information became widely transmissible,</p>
    <p>we entered the age of simulation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>as the simulation dilates,</p>
    <p>the window of sensation narrows</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I want you to think about me tomorrow.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I perform for the paucity of words and the density of presence</p>
    <p>I said once that information is not memory</p>
    <p>Not even memory is memory.</p>
    <p>The two must exist together.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>information can never be presence</p>
    <p>the presence is the listening.</p>
    <p>an active and embodied process.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>networks transmit presence</p>
    <p>but solidarity is not encoded</p>
    <p>in the networks that carry it</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>society demands the unceasing production of documented miracles</p>
    <p>we faithfully oblige</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>ok, so let&rsquo;s talk about vr.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>questions about technology are really questions about being.</p>
    <p>computing begins and ends with human bodies</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Not only do we already live in a unified and synchronous simulation, no living person has experienced a reality in which this simulation is not present and active. The resolution of a simulation does not increase its resonance, it only blurs the edges. The metaverse already exists.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This vector display was modeled after the Digital Equipment Corporation&rsquo;s PDP-1 mainframe computer. You can see my avatar in ASCII on the screen. The PDP-1 was famously used in 1962 by researchers at MIT to create the first video game: Space War. The first time-sharing system for mainframe computers was designed so students at the university could play the &nbsp;game, thus originating the social construction of the individuated user.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The PDP-1 was developed by Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson in 1957, after working under famed systems theorist Jay Forrester to develop the SAGE air defense system.</p>

    <p>The first computer based simulation?</p>

    <p>War.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The reality is virtual, but the consequences are material.</p>

    <p>The substrate of our simulation is not software, it&rsquo;s culture.</p>

    <p>Hey, I know who decided there would be a second web, his name is Tim!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some guy made up this name to describe the companies that survived the dot com boom, so he could get people to come to his conferences and learn how to be like Google.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So is it a new web?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>or a new market opportunity?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This Macintosh is a recurring figure in my work&mdash; I call them His and Hers computers, a visual metaphor for digital files as tethers between past and present. Because all experience is durational and time is a type of space, the cascading moments of retrieval form congruent ripples in time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The device itself, the Macintosh, remains an object of technological grief for me.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Steve spoke the language of San Francisco counterculture</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>And performed a miracle</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He turned the language of revolutions onto the practice of branding.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Technology is not inherently liberatory.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So when McKinsey tells me that the value of virtual real estate will be 400 quadrillion dollars in 2040, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a revolution, it sounds like a coup.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t forget Steve flew a pirate flag over Cupertino.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He changed the world.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Why did he want to?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He wanted to make a world</p>
    <p>that he controlled.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When I hear the word innovation,</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I feel grief.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I dream of computing that feels like</p>
    <p>augmented presence</p>
    <p>cultivated through generations of loving care</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A networked unfolding in the fullness of time</p>
    <p>A dilating interconnection</p>
    <p>on our long stroll back to totality</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>programs like recipes</p>
    <p>code like carrots</p>
    <p>And hardware like wood</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Wet</p>
    <p>Messy</p>
    <p>Alive</p>

    <div class="content">
    <p>I really didn&rsquo;t expect to make it here. Living as a woman, living as an artist, living at all. When I moved back to Los Angeles three years ago, I knew I needed to be an artist, but I had no idea how to begin. The community I encountered here was supportive beyond my wildest expectations. It is a privilege to be a part of this constellation, contributing a piece which so many of my fellow contributors helped guide into existence. The art we make today is a gift to an unknown future. It is a promise to exist, and a frontier on which to be held. Art works are like mushrooms: fruiting bodies of a collective unconscious only incidentally authored by an individual. We are mycelium.</p>
    <p>It is a gift to be in community, and the tools we use as digital artists encode our interconnections. We make tools and share them with one another, inscribing ourselves on the instrument, the output, and one another in the process. The pre-internet age valued a concept of solo genius, pinning movements to people and objects. In an age of constantly transforming technology, we are constant beginners. Domain expertise is no longer possible in the same way. Every piece feels in some way like an experiment, a tension between &ldquo;will it work?&rdquo; and &ldquo;will it resonate?&rdquo; The technology we use is as important as how we use it, and this is a collective process of discovery.</p>
    <p>I make art about being trans, but it&rsquo;s really about grief and digital memory. The inciting incident of my practice occurred in the year between my two lives, as the old self ceded agency to the new one. I use the metaphor of a &lsquo;dead husband&rsquo; to describe the man I used to live as. He made up the name Tvordis Veeler and I kept his surname after I transitioned. In my name, Sammie Veeler, I encode the act of remembrance. There is a common pressure to memory hole the pre-transition self, but I chose to view it as collaboration. I am in solidarity with this past self, and in many ways an emissary of his vision. The mushroom metaphor was his. These iterations of myself both before and after transition are ancestors who led me here.</p>
    <p>When he wrote those words, it felt like he was surrounded by a chorus of angels calling him to step through to the other side. In the moment of inscription, he encoded an infinity of future retrievals. In this eternal present we are like switchboard operators, patching connections between past and future. By writing those words, he picked up the phone, and I answer on the other end over and over.</p>
    <p>It was like I woke up one morning with this man&rsquo;s memories and his personal computer, and had to make sense of what I found there. My embodied memory was already foggy&ndash; it is hard to inscribe memory in the derealized state of dysphoria. I relied on the mediated memories he left on his computer to reconstruct the narrative that led me to this catalyzing point. I knew that it would be my last year experiencing reality tinted by my endogenous testosterone, and that in re-accessing the memories of my last life, I would rewrite them. This was the last time I would see my life through that lens. I dove headfirst into his archive of images and the art he made in private, graphomaniacally documenting my associations with them. Indeed once I began taking estrogen, I returned again to all of those old sensations, tapping the resonances, observing the result, and reinscribing those memories once more. Three years later, the last life feels like a dream.</p>
    <p>In A Time Capsule or a Grave, the ongoing performative lecture series which I contributed to Mirror, I expose this digital grief ritual which incited my practice as an artist. I document my processes of remembrance and memory production, along with the technologies that shaped them. I perform a verbal address with a persistent virtual world projected behind me. When I prepare remarks in advance, I publish them as essays. The world itself is an archive of art Tvordis made, and I play the fictional character of the female archivist of a dead male artist. I record the audio of each performance and install it in the virtual at each space where I speak. Each iteration is then performed alongside a rising chorus of dead Sammies.</p>
    <p>The performances aim to expose ignorance in the process of learning as I cultivate a voice in real time. My formal education in political theory trained me to research facts to support claims. The tone of the early essays is stiff, dogmatic, somber. I realized lately that I turn to books and artists in search of solidarity, not facts. A name for a sensation. I want to be willowy, warm, intimate.</p>
    <p>We use the same tools to inscribe memory as we do to make art. The instantaneity of networked reality dilates the present, writing signs over one another and rewriting our memories in the process. In the hyperpresent, conceptions of past and future recede into the background. The profusion of digital archives adds instant recall to our process of historical production, reassimilating the past into the long present. Our work is often more accurately expressed in flows, processes, and interconnections encoded in networks, but beginning and ending with human bodies.</p>
    <p>The documentation we leave behind is interdependent with our embodied memory. These mediated memories can exist in objects and people. We carry the network of memory. To archive is to encode a future retrieval, to give a gift to a future person you don&rsquo;t know, who may be seeking solidarity in the traces you leave here.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b><i>Eulogy</i></b><br><i class=subscript>August 12, 2023</i></button>
    <div class="content"> 
    <p>my husband, Tvordis Veeler, made the music we&rsquo;re listening to right now.</p>
    <p>I love to perform these temporal duets with him.</p>
    <p>This is my first time performing one without a computer</p>
    <p>or a virtual world behind me.</p>
    <p>You can see what I do with computers in Catalyst.</p>
    <p>Today I&rsquo;d like to be in my body.</p>
    <p>For the longest time I felt like this presence</p>
    <p>hovering over the scene of his life.</p>
    <p>A silent witness to an unfolding play</p>
    <p>that I would one day have a part in.</p>
    <p>some days I feel like an emissary of his vision.</p>
    <p>it&rsquo;s an interesting shape to carry.</p>
    <p>the female archivist of the dead male artist.</p>
    <p>one of the best ways for a man to increase the market value of his art is to die</p>
    <p>Tvordis was in on the joke.</p>
    <p>he released the tape in June.</p>
    <p>in August, he was dead.</p>
    <p>11 days from now makes three years since he left the body.</p>
    <p>for the past 9 months I&rsquo;ve been performing his eulogy as a lecture.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>in places where lectures are expected.</p>
    <p>for 9 months I&rsquo;ve gestated this swimming memory</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m shopping for a voice</p>
    <p>and it might be my own.</p>
    <p>I look back at my words from last year, the first time I performed the eulogy.</p>
    <p>stiff. dogmatic.</p>
    <p>syllabic. didactic.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>written to be read, not spoken.</p>
    <p>if I could just argue forcefully enough, maybe I could be heard.</p>
    <p>I cried in that church in Arles</p>
    <p>for 60 confused and sympathetic media artists</p>
    <p>thinking about the echoing empty church in Belgium</p>
    <p>where we whispered our vows.</p>
    <p>his parents weren&rsquo;t happy about it</p>
    <p>but there was nothing they could do.</p>
    <p>they came around eventually.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>how do you eulogize a man who loved to eulogize himself?</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve heard the song many times, so I know how it goes.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m happy to keep singing it.</p>
    <p>His self-eulogy was rarely solemn.</p>
    <p>He liked making himself silly compared against eternity and oblivion.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve never met somebody so obsessed with ego death.</p>
    <p>On our first date he spent 20 minutes talking about acid trips.</p>
    <p>And somehow I could have listened to him talk for hours.</p>
    <p>He said so matter of factly that, unfortunately,</p>
    <p>he had lived before, and he would live again.</p>
    <p>he told me about the initial terror of this insight.</p>
    <p>he wanted the stillness. to go back to the source.</p>
    <p>he told me about the gradual unfolding awareness</p>
    <p>that we came from another world and found each other in this one.</p>
    <p>it&rsquo;s not that we didn&rsquo;t choose to be born,</p>
    <p>we just don&rsquo;t remember choosing.</p>
    <p>he spoke for a future past.</p>
    <p>somehow knowing that the things he left behind would be retrieved.</p>
    <p>the dead only exist to the extent that we remember them.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>he was so obsessed with these tapes</p>
    <p>and he told me all about how he made them</p>
    <p>I listened intently and there was a time when, good student that I am,</p>
    <p>I could describe his process verbatim.</p>
    <p>I loved to see the way his eyes would light up when he spoke.</p>
    <p>But really, I could care less how he made them.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m always more interested in the why.</p>
    <p>I said, honey, I&rsquo;m going to forget all this, and so are you.</p>
    <p>please write this down.</p>
    <p>Good boy, he listened.</p>
    <p>if my work is about memory, his was about forgetting.</p>
    <p>buried in these sound maps are these precious traces of his voice.</p>
    <p>performing for the air.</p>
    <p>for an audience he understood he would likely never know.</p>
    <p>he makes me work to find the traces.</p>
    <p>He called it an unstaged film. And I am the faithful archivist, editing a million glittering fragments, weaving past into present.</p>
    <p>As I was preparing for this performance, I found some writing of his that I thought was lost. This happens all the time. The man documented feverishly, but he had no sense of organization.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I cried when I accidentally recorded half of The Source. Thank god I still have the original. I knew the song by heart anyway.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Today I performed Pauline Oliveros&apos;s sonic meditation &quot;Learn To Fly&quot; as I prepared a handheld dictophone to hold my precious source. I&apos;ve heard the song so many times before, you know?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Still I cried, and I recorded it! If I had only hit record. And so, I sighed yawn sighs down and down and down, probing my breath, practicing my miracles for the camera. And as soon as I probed my natural register (above my smooth tenor) I felt the totality yet to behold. The clumsiness with which I attempted arcing gestures upward brought me to tears as soon as I hit the vein. And laughter followed. The funniest joke of all, 1 second of the ordeal was recorded, and this mistake was an intention un-hidden.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Before it was art, it was a joke.</p>
    <p>His life was aesthetic and it was intentional.</p>
    <p>He knew it and he wrote about it and it was funny.</p>
    <p>He wrote unhinged poems and posted them on Facebook.</p>
    <p>Our friends roared with laughter.</p>
    <p>Ornate, clinical descriptions of cooking without eating.</p>
    <p>Each ending with the refrain, &ldquo;to begin again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>When I read them now, they make me cry.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ll never forget when he told me about the greatest compliment he ever received.</p>
    <p>Somebody told him, &ldquo;in order to understand Tvordis Veeler, you have to accept that it isn&rsquo;t an act.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>He was passing.</p>
    <p>Still, it struck me funny.</p>
    <p>A bit too perfect when he picked me up in his little red convertible</p>
    <p>turned on the Velvet Underground cassette and Pale Blue Eyes was cued up.</p>
    <p>I remember him graduating college, earnestly pursuing a career in business because he felt he was obligated to use his privilege to infiltrate Silicon Valley.</p>
    <p>He took it so seriously, even as he came to understand how unserious it was.</p>
    <p>His dad told him that he should be an artist, but Tvordis brushed him off.</p>
    <p>He made art for the joy of making it.</p>
    <p>Not in this lifetime, he said.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>he never got to see me as a woman</p>
    <p>but he carried me right up until the moment he had to go.</p>
    <p>sometimes I felt like the teen drama queen</p>
    <p>in his serious boy Lifetime movie</p>
    <p>like I was programmed for his dream</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t really know where I came from</p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t have a legal status in this country.</p>
    <p>solidarity keeps me alive.</p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t have a family of my own</p>
    <p>and his parents, Greg and Jocelyn&hellip; they&rsquo;ve loved me like their own daughter</p>
    <p>I moved here to be near them. They still come to my art shows and invite me to dinner.</p>
    <p>Greg gave me Tvordis&rsquo;s little red convertible, which had belonged to Greg since the 80s.</p>
    <p>They even came to France to see me perform the first eulogy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I feel such deep kinship with this man whose clothes I still sometimes wear</p>
    <p>Whose car I drive</p>
    <p>And whose computer I dig through at least once a week</p>
    <p>looking for more surfaces I never got to touch.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In my first hour of knowing him,</p>
    <p>Tvordis taught me that not even death is death.</p>
    <p>He didn&rsquo;t die, he lived.</p>
    <p>And he showed me what happens when you turn off the lights.</p>
    <p>He had the courage to end his world as he knew it.</p>
    <p>And at that moment, my world began.</p>

    <div class="content">    
    <p>so sorry to interrupt because this is</p>
    <p>very interesting okay yeah so I mean not</p>
    <p>many artists get to sort of curate their</p>
    <p>own work from the jump and so now I&apos;ve</p>
    <p>been doing this for long enough that I</p>
    <p>have</p>
    <p>probably 30 or so worlds or like 3D</p>
    <p>spaces that I&apos;ve made on New Art City and</p>
    <p>they&apos;re basically a throughline across</p>
    <p>all of the visual art I&apos;ve ever made</p>
    <p>um and this is kind of one of the</p>
    <p>central parts of my practice and this</p>
    <p>was this was the case before I started</p>
    <p>working in in Virtual space even that</p>
    <p>like</p>
    <p>um</p>
    <p>I&apos;m really interested in personal</p>
    <p>archives and so</p>
    <p>like one of the like processes that I go</p>
    <p>through is I return to a file that I</p>
    <p>made a long time ago the more cringe the</p>
    <p>better and it always without fail kind</p>
    <p>of shows me</p>
    <p>what I was feeling in a way that I</p>
    <p>couldn&apos;t tell when I was inscribing it</p>
    <p>and it sort of becomes this like Pathway&nbsp;</p>
    <p>to involuntary memory and so I now kind</p>
    <p>of do this process intentionally where</p>
    <p>whenever I drop an artifact in my hard</p>
    <p>drive that I&apos;ve made I know that it&apos;s</p>
    <p>inscribing my sight and my blindness</p>
    <p>simultaneously</p>
    <p>um</p>
    <p>and this is kind of a spiritual practice</p>
    <p>right because</p>
    <p>if you have a file stored in a a solid</p>
    <p>state hard drive</p>
    <p>these little bits are stored in what are</p>
    <p>called electron charge traps when you</p>
    <p>put a file in there those same electrons</p>
    <p>will stay right where they are until yo</p>
    <p>delete it and so it&apos;s not trivial to say</p>
    <p>that current me and past me are both</p>
    <p>touching the same substance when we</p>
    <p>interact with it the other Quirk of</p>
    <p>digital files right and this is the this</p>
    <p>is true of my previous Virtual Worlds</p>
    <p>cassette tapes</p>
    <p>they&apos;re always accessed in</p>
    <p>Translation they</p>
    <p>um they always kind of point to an</p>
    <p>invisible original and they only perform</p>
    <p>their objecthood when they&apos;re accessed</p>
    <p>so this becomes a really potent metaphor</p>
    <p>for time I think that the fourth</p>
    <p>dimension is a type of space and I</p>
    <p>believe that all time has already</p>
    <p>happened and we&apos;re only accessing it</p>
    <p>linearly just like the playhead on a</p>
    <p>cassette player</p>
    <p>um and so my latest kind of series of</p>
    <p>work has been a lot about</p>
    <p>take like creating this conversation</p>
    <p>between my like versions of myself over</p>
    <p>time and so as we think about kind of</p>
    <p>ghosting the binary body</p>
    <p>in</p>
    <p>um in uh glitch feminism right</p>
    <p>uh she&apos;s talking about gender yes and</p>
    <p>that&apos;s important but I think ghosting</p>
    <p>the idea of a single stable self across</p>
    <p>time is equally important that that the</p>
    <p>the self is not binary it&apos;s it&apos;s not 10</p>
    <p>100 it&apos;s like the identity is an</p>
    <p>uncountable quantity it&apos;s it&apos;s an</p>
    <p>infinite thing</p>
    <p>um</p>
    <p>and so I guess I could even</p>
    <p>take you through this world that I uh</p>
    <p>that&apos;s been kind of the site of my</p>
    <p>latest series of performances called a</p>
    <p>time capsule or a grave</p>
    <p>if you&apos;ll permit me to screen share I</p>
    <p>believe I am permitted yes</p>
    <p>okay</p>
    <p>so there&apos;s an there&apos;s an essay that I</p>
    <p>wrote here I mean I might as well just</p>
    <p>read it yes so what is going on here</p>
    <p>I didn&apos;t know what I was doing until it</p>
    <p>was already already done</p>
    <p>a time capsule or a grave is my first</p>
    <p>serious attempt to involve performance</p>
    <p>in my practice the work exists in a</p>
    <p>hybrid format I activate a persistent</p>
    <p>virtual space on new art city with IRL</p>
    <p>performances the audio of which are</p>
    <p>recorded and installed spatially in the</p>
    <p>virtual after each iteration this essay</p>
    <p>itself is a momentary capsule of</p>
    <p>subjectivity</p>
    <p>a week before I went to perform the</p>
    <p>piece for the first time at Octobre</p>
    <p>Numerique Faire Monde in Arles, France</p>
    <p>um Lauren Lee McCarthy introduced me to</p>
    <p>her idea of a performance in progress</p>
    <p>I&apos;d already planned to record the audio</p>
    <p>from the performance and install clips</p>
    <p>in this space at each place that I spoke</p>
    <p>but Lauren sparked the idea that I could</p>
    <p>perform that piece multiple times</p>
    <p>my late husband Tvordis Veeler was</p>
    <p>obsessed with Finnegans Wake one of the</p>

    <p>include a ricorso between Cycles which I</p>
    <p>view something like eddying out on</p>
    <p>the River of time as I write this A Time</p>
    <p>Capsule or A Grave has been performed</p>
    <p>four times and the ricorso came second</p>
    <p>through a collaboration with Emji St Spero&nbsp;</p>
    <p>the production of each age and the first&nbsp;</p>
    <p>cycle of performances formed a&nbsp;</p>
    <p>tightening temporal Loop so A Time</p>
    <p>Capsule or a Grave, the original one,</p>
    <p>it took about three months to write the</p>
    <p>essay and build the world</p>
    <p>um What Will You Be Like Before What</p>
    <p>Were You Like After which is the ricorso&nbsp;</p>
    <p>was a product of basically a one hour&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Pomodoro writing exercise which we then</p>
    <p>immediately recorded</p>
    <p>um About My Avatar took about three</p>
    <p>weeks and His and Hers was the the</p>
    <p>latest performance and this was I didn&apos;t</p>
    <p>prepare any remarks so it took me about</p>
    <p>three hours to kind of get my head</p>
    <p>together for it so did I designed them</p>
    <p>this way with the Viconian cycle in mind</p>

    <p>no</p>
    <p>it is a comfortable frame from my</p>
    <p>former literary obsession with which to</p>
    <p>name the phenomena that I&apos;ve observed in</p>
    <p>this process</p>
    <p>wait you said your husband was the Joycean</p>
    <p>yes Tvordis was my previous Avatar</p>
    <p>an identity to which I&apos;m wedded but</p>
    <p>which is no longer alive</p>
    <p>this fiction</p>
    <p>was not revealed as fiction until the</p>
    <p>third iteration of the performance</p>
    <p>increments of time and space have the&nbsp;</p>
    <p>same statistical character as the whole</p>
    <p>in the same way I hope this essay will</p>
    <p>mirror the constellation of objects and</p>
    <p>processes that make up this work</p>
    <p>this first cycle of exploration has</p>
    <p>revealed that the process of observing</p>


    <p>and naming the particularities in this</p>


    <p>world must be Central to the work going</p>


    <p>uh going forward indeed it has defined</p>


    <p>all of the efforts leading here as well</p>


    <p>words spiral out of the rupture of an</p>


    <p>encounter with the past self as other</p>


    <p>and the future self itself the best way</p>


    <p>to show My Future Self what I can&apos;t see</p>


    <p>today is is to get out of my own way and</p>


    <p>try to name the sensations</p>


    <p>even though I made these worlds and</p>


    <p>everything in them the internal logic</p>


    <p>here remains unclear I still get lost</p>


    <p>the process of this piece is becoming a</p>


    <p>pataphysical study of phenomena taking</p>


    <p>place here</p>


    <p>toward</p>


    <p>Sammie</p>


    <p>like I haven&apos;t read that essay in a</p>


    <p>little while so it&apos;s kind of it&apos;s kind</p>


    <p>of interesting</p>


    <p>it&apos;s fun I really enjoyed as a piece of</p>


    <p>writing</p>


    <p>most of my pieces are also essays</p>


    <p>so we&apos;re gonna let dead Sammies talk for</p>


    <p>a while my name is Sammie Veeler and this</p>


    <p>piece is called A Time Capsule or a</p>


    <p>Grave</p>


    <p>on the internet nobody knows you&apos;re a</p>


    <p>dog</p>


    <p>nobody knows you&apos;re a singular person</p>


    <p>indeed nobody knows you&apos;re still alive</p>


    <p>the networked age has shifted the</p>


    <p>production of history from a one to many</p>


    <p>to a many-to-many process not only does</p>


    <p>everybody produce history they become</p>


    <p>historians as well</p>


    <p>Art&apos;s role in historical production has</p>


    <p>shifted along the same lines</p>


    <p>information is abundant and making</p>


    <p>meaning from it now is a collective</p>


    <p>responsibility</p>


    <p>we must not confuse information for</p>


    <p>memory</p>


    <p>memory the information exists in the</p>


    <p>machine memory is constituted in the</p>


    <p>body</p>


    <p>I address you in my capacity as the</p>


    <p>title executor of the estate of devorus</p>


    <p>villa my late husband and as a curator</p>


    <p>whose work concerns the digital</p>


    <p>preservation of cultural memory</p>


    <p>I&apos;m a steward of my husband&apos;s most</p>


    <p>intimate digital device his personal</p>


    <p>computer which he called Theseus</p>


    <p>the world will Traverse here are moments</p>


    <p>outside time between two local machines</p>


    <p>his and hers</p>


    <p>these worlds were created in</p>


    <p>constellation with peers who guided and</p>


    <p>inspired my work</p>


    <p>from the body to some sort of</p>


    <p>disembodied state</p>


    <p>you know if you think about a metaphor</p>


    <p>of living and dying</p>


    <p>we&apos;re each embodied in this sort of</p>


    <p>container and extruded through time like</p>


    <p>a playhead on a cassette player</p>


    <p>all time has already happened and we&apos;re</p>


    <p>only experiencing it linearly</p>


    <p>and so</p>


    <p>if you think about what makes a world</p>


    <p>it took me a long time to figure that</p>


    <p>out even though I run this virtual Art</p>


    <p>Space right</p>


    <p>and sort of trying to uncover the</p>


    <p>internal Logics of what it means to</p>


    <p>exist in Virtual space</p>


    <p>has been really important to me not just</p>


    <p>as an artist but also as running a</p>


    <p>virtual space which was founded before</p>


    <p>the you know the use of the metaverse</p>


    <p>saw this Resurgence and so I&apos;m</p>


    <p>constantly asking myself what is virtual</p>


    <p>embodiment what is trust what is a</p>


    <p>sovereign identity online</p>


    <p>and so as we think about these transits</p>


    <p>between physical and virtual</p>


    <p>this image attempts to</p>


    <p>perhaps</p>


    <p>visualize the metaphor that I&apos;m trying</p>


    <p>to talk about here so on the left you</p>


    <p>see an old Macintosh and the stickers on</p>


    <p>it are actually the same stickers on the</p>


    <p>laptop I&apos;m using</p>


    <p>and on the right is my late husband</p>


    <p>tortoise you can see the man himself</p>


    <p>here on the screen and that is his</p>


    <p>personal computer which he calls Theseus</p>


    <p>um and I&apos;ve taken on this role of</p>


    <p>archivist of this artifact</p>


    <p>um and sort of</p>


    <p>my contact with the artifacts there the</p>


    <p>things that he was too afraid to call</p>


    <p>Art</p>


    <p>um I now get to be the curator of this</p>


    <p>archive and it&apos;s not just</p>


    <p>you know touching an artifact it&apos;s a</p>


    <p>portal through time between me and this</p>


    <p>other person</p>


    <p>and so the internet</p>


    <p>transmits something which is not</p>


    <p>encodable</p>


    <p>and so as we move towards embodiment</p>


    <p>this is how I view myself in Virtual</p>


    <p>space this is a poor resolution image</p>


    <p>but we are after all always copies in</p>


    <p>motion</p>


    <p>I think as a trans person</p>


    <p>do I really want another body do I want</p>


    <p>one body</p>


    <p>have I not learned already through my</p>


    <p>own experience that identity is mutable</p>


    <p>and that&apos;s part of the fun</p>


    <p>so let&apos;s zoom out a little bit more</p>


    <p>kind of what my work looks like</p>


    <p>so</p>


    <p>it&apos;s well known that art appreciates in</p>


    <p>value after the death of the artist</p>


    <p>but what death are we considering</p>


    <p>the soul departing the body or</p>


    <p>The Voice departing its origin</p>


    <p>in the Twilight of my husband&apos;s life he</p>


    <p>promised me his computer and challenged</p>


    <p>me to examine this Archive of a mask in</p>


    <p>its incompleteness</p>


    <p>to lift these files out of their grave</p>


    <p>and put them in places they would never</p>


    <p>expect to find themselves</p>


    <p>through this gift of his uncurated</p>


    <p>digital self he ensured I would never be</p>


    <p>alone in my dream</p>


    <p>I built this world but most of the</p>


    <p>artifacts you see installed here were</p>


    <p>actually made by him from his [ __ ] posts</p>


    <p>to his self-portraits to his sound</p>


    <p>collages that&apos;s what&apos;s here</p>


    <p>thank you</p>


    <p>I always get in yeah</p>


    <p>[Music]</p>


    <p>I&apos;m often summoned to perform expertise</p>


    <p>regarding our purported transition into</p>


    <p>the metaverse</p>


    <p>it&apos;s my belief that competing Computing</p>


    <p>already envelops us in a way that</p>


    <p>renders it invisible</p>


    <p>in the metaverse heaven is a data center</p>


    <p>and we&apos;re there together now</p>


    <p>we&apos;ve lived there for over a decade</p>


    <p>already</p>


    <p>logging onto the internet is a way to</p>


    <p>leave the body</p>


    <p>logging on is no longer an intentional</p>


    <p>process but a natural state of existence</p>


    <p>it&apos;s easier to log on than it is to log</p>


    <p>off</p>


    <p>easier to store a file than it is to</p>


    <p>delete it</p>


    <p>our default state is disembodied</p>


    <p>and our default identity is plural</p>


    <p>in the data center our virtual souls are</p>


    <p>mixed together as anonymized digital</p>


    <p>residue</p>


    <p>up there we are one body</p>


    <p>so what does it mean</p>


    <p>when a society collectively and</p>


    <p>involuntarily astral projects casting</p>


    <p>data shadows as we travel</p>


    <p>we are always in the presence of our own</p>


    <p>ghosts</p>


    <p>ancestors may be more apt</p>


    <p>we constantly depart and reinhabit this</p>


    <p>new network World our consciousnesses</p>


    <p>exist stride embodiment and</p>


    <p>disembodiment</p>


    <p>to leave the body can be both</p>


    <p>dehumanizing and liberating</p>

    <p>summons</p>


    <p>warm expertise</p>


    <p>I&apos;m so confused and the key seems like</p>


    <p>it&apos;s stuck down</p>


    <p>let me hit a refresh</p>


    <p>I love the the idea though of you</p>


    <p>getting like lost in your own world or</p>


    <p>like not being able to perfectly</p>


    <p>navigate</p>


    <p>I do it happens</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>especially in the older ones I yeah I</p>


    <p>even I I&apos;ve</p>


    <p>that was recorded in one of the other</p>


    <p>performances I did okay okay</p>


    <p>so right I think a lot about the cloud</p>


    <p>um the way that Computing is kind of</p>


    <p>made consciously invisible that like</p>


    <p>the web 2 era is really designed to</p>


    <p>reduce friction at any time you have</p>


    <p>like a low friction experience online</p>


    <p>dollars to Donuts you&apos;re [ __ ] getting</p>


    <p>exploded in one way or another</p>


    <p>because if you think about it for a</p>


    <p>little bit too long you&apos;re going to</p>


    <p>realize what the what the gag is and so</p>


    <p>self-hosting your own little web server</p>


    <p>and stuff</p>


    <p>it&apos;s more difficult it&apos;s also</p>


    <p>significantly more autonomous so what</p>


    <p>what it it lacks in low friction and</p>


    <p>makes up for in dogshit user experience</p>


    <p>you know so it&apos;s like</p>


    <p>that&apos;s that&apos;s what they&apos;re trying to</p>


    <p>take from us I guess is like the yeah</p>


    <p>the ability to like</p>


    <p>compute in a way that makes sense to us</p>


    <p>rather than sort of inform our</p>


    <p>experience of computing to somebody</p>

    <p>was Stern and urgent</p>


    <p>I played a character of the female</p>


    <p>archivist preserving the legacy of a</p>


    <p>dead male artist</p>


    <p>polemic was for them and the eulogy is</p>


    <p>for you</p>


    <p>the metaphor of death</p>


    <p>which I didn&apos;t reveal as a metaphor to</p>


    <p>the festival audience it was one of</p>


    <p>those negotiations trans people used to</p>


    <p>trick cis people into seeing us</p>


    <p>I think it&apos;s it&apos;s safe to assume that</p>


    <p>the audience of An All Trans performance</p>


    <p>program does not need the same coddling</p>


    <p>so let me drop the metaphor and speak</p>


    <p>frankly</p>


    <p>I think many of us are familiar with the</p>


    <p>oversimplifications we use to make</p>


    <p>ourselves legible to cis people</p>


    <p>some are more pernicious than others</p>


    <p>it&apos;s like I&apos;m I was a woman trapped in a</p>


    <p>man&apos;s body presupposes a self-divided</p>


    <p>into discreet and opposing entities when</p>


    <p>in reality we&apos;re not one to ten or ten</p>


    <p>thousand</p>


    <p>identity is an uncountable quantity</p>


    <p>or as weapons right so here&apos;s one of the</p>


    <p>phenomena that happens when I I automate</p>


    <p>myself which is I&apos;m like this is great</p>


    <p>you know let her do the talking couldn&apos;t</p>


    <p>have said it better myself</p>


    <p>um but sometimes when I speak off the</p>


    <p>cuff in the interstitial zones I repeat</p>


    <p>repeat phases with Beta And so this is</p>


    <p>literally an echo across time</p>

    <p>he was studying in Paris during third</p>


    <p>year at University and which he never</p>


    <p>removed</p>


    <p>he made this act real by changing his</p>


    <p>name on Facebook</p>


    <p>masks reflect few intentions back on the</p>


    <p>mirror on the wearer like a negative</p>


    <p>mirror</p>


    <p>I&apos;m awed by the Great Lengths he went to</p>


    <p>trying to find comfort in the</p>


    <p>masculinity he felt obligated to perform</p>


    <p>hated being a man</p>


    <p>he had the respect according to him by</p>


    <p>other men</p>


    <p>the subtle shift in framing he began to</p>


    <p>view his life as a performance and this</p>


    <p>was the difference between drowning and</p>


    <p>Diving</p>


    <p>what will you be like before</p>


    <p>big</p>


    <p>graceful</p>


    <p>at a table</p>


    <p>drenched in white stage light</p>


    <p>you imagine yourself into your own</p>

    <p>where do you go when you leave the body</p>


    <p>Heaven is a data center</p>


    <p>the data center is a place on Earth</p>


    <p>yeah I didn&apos;t really know what was going</p>


    <p>to be around this corner</p>


    <p>but this this is what what is called</p>


    <p>who&apos;s bad boy art</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>the previous performance is really</p>


    <p>garbled and I just like to think that</p>


    <p>you know that line between now and then</p>


    <p>is somehow like a shark&apos;s chewing on the</p>


    <p>undersea table or something</p>


    <p>[Music]</p>


    <p>the first video art I ever made years</p>


    <p>and years ago</p>


    <p>yeah I mean maybe this this kind of</p>


    <p>connects to the way I feel about</p>


    <p>curation that like if it was decided in</p>


    <p>the 20th century that everybody must be</p>


    <p>an artist and that everything is hard I</p>


    <p>think uh in in this century</p>


    <p>curation kind of has to undergo that</p>


    <p>same transformation that they&apos;re simply</p>


    <p>too many fucking images you cannot sort</p>


    <p>of have the interrelation of them be an</p>


    <p>art in itself and you know curation was</p>


    <p>billed to me as something that you need</p>


    <p>uh</p>


    <p>a very very pernicious illusion</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>I guess as a side note New Art City has</p>


    <p>facilitated the like countless</p>


    <p>curatorial debuts and that&apos;s like not</p>


    <p>really warms my heart because I think</p>


    <p>it&apos;s really an operative for people that</p>


    <p>matters a lot to me moreover</p>


    <p>I&apos;m sure all of you follow meme Pages</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>these people are doing that labor right</p>


    <p>there are way too many fucking tik</p>


    <p>toks and like why do you follow a meme</p>


    <p>page yes they have good tik toks but</p>


    <p>they also have a perspective that is</p>


    <p>evident in the assemblages that they</p>


    <p>make and I think this is a non-trivial</p>


    <p>form of curation that doesn&apos;t get nearly</p>


    <p>enough attention</p>


    <p>many of the artifacts toward us left</p>


    <p>behind were stereophonic field</p>


    <p>recordings and sound collages that he</p>


    <p>created from those recordings</p>


    <p>these two are virtual spaces and he</p>


    <p>viewed them that way</p>


    <p>he captured field recordings to</p>


    <p>construct incongruous sound spaces with</p>


    <p>them</p>


    <p>his sound worlds are embodied time</p>


    <p>experienced durationally</p>


    <p>they only perform their objecthood when</p>


    <p>they&apos;re accessed</p>


    <p>these worlds like all media files are</p>


    <p>only ever accessed in Translation they</p>


    <p>always point back to an invisible</p>


    <p>original</p>


    <p>in his recordings he also took care to</p>


    <p>make himself invisible but he&apos;s present</p>


    <p>with us as a fellow listener</p>


    <p>in five years of his field recordings</p>


    <p>I&apos;ve found not a single trace of his</p>


    <p>voice</p>


    <p>his absence however is a form of</p>


    <p>presence which is drawn out through his</p>


    <p>mistakes</p>


    <p>I feel him when he jostles the recorder</p>


    <p>and Jingles his keys</p>


    <p>it clicks his tongue to test the shape</p>


    <p>of a room</p>


    <p>I argue that a virtual space can be</p>


    <p>defined as a third space between two or</p>


    <p>more physical spaces these can be</p>


    <p>localized in both space and time</p>


    <p>is only alone in his field recordings</p>


    <p>when I&apos;m not there to listen with him</p>


    <p>when I join him in these spaces he left</p>


    <p>for me our virtual selves are equally</p>


    <p>unburdened by time and the body</p>


    <p>the boundary between our Consciousness</p>


    <p>is blurs</p>


    <p>on the other side of time</p>


    <p>there is a hand reaching back to you</p>


    <p>however you must choose to grasp it</p>


    <p>can you be sure which hand is yours</p>


    <p>it&apos;s like listening to a song that I</p>


    <p>know the lyrics to</p>


    <p>yeah</p>


    <p>um I mean I&apos;m glad that we&apos;re doing this</p>


    <p>because when I visit these worlds it</p>


    <p>kind of</p>


    <p>it becomes this like involuntary memory</p>


    <p>I I recently had a studio visit</p>


    <p>um where I took somebody back to</p>


    <p>um a performance piece that I made a</p>


    <p>very long time ago that I viewed as a</p>


    <p>performance but mostly forgot about it</p>


    <p>must have been about two years ago and</p>


    <p>once we reached the climax of the piece</p>


    <p>that I had completely forgotten that I</p>


    <p>had made we both cried together and so</p>


    <p>this person kind of like witnessed the</p>


    <p>operative phenomena of my work in action</p>


    <p>um and I find that I meant to record</p>


    <p>that but this is kind of like the ghost</p>


    <p>in the machine that like the last time I</p>


    <p>had tried to record and document a</p>


    <p>phenomena like this reading Finnegan&apos;s</p>


    <p>wake and also bursting into tears at the</p>


    <p>climax of this of this uh like random</p>


    <p>passage that I read</p>


    <p>the first time I did it</p>


    <p>I didn&apos;t record it and it was you know</p>


    <p>this is for the air is what I always say</p>


    <p>when that happens and it was very</p>


    <p>interesting that I did this studio visit</p>


    <p>after this cycle of performances and</p>


    <p>that one was for the air</p>


    <p>um actually I wonder do you want to maybe</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>talk a little bit about the like</p>


    <p>chandelier shape and how it connects to</p>


    <p>the text that you&apos;re thinking about just</p>


    <p>because I I don&apos;t know how</p>


    <p>familiar with Joyce anyone in this Zoom</p>


    <p>oh the chandelier has nothing to do with</p>


    <p>Joyce oh it&apos;s not the the Joyce one huh</p>


    <p>no that is actually my avatar and I that</p>


    <p>was what the second performance of Time</p>


    <p>Capsule was about so there is an essay</p>


    <p>that I wrote specifically about the way</p>


    <p>I view the queer Avatar</p>


    <p>um because that&apos;s kind of one of the my</p>


    <p>bug bears with these conceptions of the</p>


    <p>metaverse that people are kind of</p>


    <p>externally trying to Market to us that</p>


    <p>like you know the patronizing thing that</p>


    <p>says people will tell me is like oh you</p>


    <p>can have an avatar in Virtual space and</p>


    <p>it can be whatever you want it&apos;s like I</p>


    <p>did this with my physical body</p>


    <p>um like I I&apos;m I&apos;m familiar with the</p>


    <p>concept of a [ __ ] mutable identity</p>


    <p>right</p>


    <p>um yeah like so I&apos;m not I don&apos;t</p>


    <p>I don&apos;t really want to have a bipedal</p>


    <p>body in Virtual space I don&apos;t really</p>


    <p>want to be represented in this kind of</p>


    <p>skew more of a physical body and so most</p>


    <p>of the ways that I really experience</p>


    <p>virtual embodiment is through text and</p>


    <p>this has happened in a lot of really</p>


    <p>resonant ways throughout my life where</p>


    <p>it&apos;s like you know before I transition</p>


    <p>falling in love over text was quite</p>


    <p>liberatory because I wasn&apos;t burdened by</p>


    <p>the sort of baggage of the male body and</p>


    <p>Persona that I was embodying in physical</p>


    <p>space and so the Avatar Miss Sammy is</p>


    <p>born when I begin running the Discord</p>


    <p>for new art study and managing this</p>


    <p>community virtually right</p>


    <p>um that like regardless of how much shit</p>


    <p>Sammie Veeler talks Miss Sammie is meant</p>


    <p>to sort of radiate positive energy to</p>


    <p>say magic is possible and it&apos;s easier</p>


    <p>than you think and so that&apos;s that&apos;s the</p>


    <p>way that I flit about in Virtual space</p>


    <p>in text and in zoom and whatever</p>


    <p>um but this visual Manifest this Avatar</p>


    <p>is meant to be a visual manifestation of</p>


    <p>that type of embodiment</p>


    <p>um but I&apos;ve never actually like imported</p>


    <p>it to a game engine and piloted it but</p>


    <p>it&apos;s like it was in it because it&apos;s like</p>


    <p>my first video art piece was kind of</p>


    <p>like a self-portrait like</p>


    <p>how fucking innovative but I think</p>


    <p>creating my own avatar was something</p>


    <p>that I put off because I kind of</p>


    <p>resented the responsibility to do it</p>


    <p>yeah absolutely yeah that makes</p>


    <p>a lot of sense I think yeah I think I</p>


    <p>was reading it as a chandelier</p>


    <p>like</p>


    <p>that shape not just because</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>of the Joyce reference but like also</p>


    <p>because I&apos;ve been obsessively thinking</p>


    <p>about the Phantom of the Opera lately</p>


    <p>and so maybe that&apos;s why I was projecting</p>


    <p>well that&apos;s that&apos;s like I&apos;m so here for</p>


    <p>subjectivity because it&apos;s I mean</p>


    <p>accessibility is a huge part of my work</p>


    <p>and visual description and so</p>


    <p>I&apos;ve written a lot of iterations of the</p>


    <p>visual description of this object and I</p>


    <p>have a sense that my current one is a</p>


    <p>little bit too dry</p>


    <p>um but I really appreciate when people</p>


    <p>visually describe my work</p>


    <p>yeah and I&apos;d love to grab my water</p>


    <p>bottle sorry oh yeah</p>


    <p>um yeah but yeah thinking about like how</p>


    <p>in Virtual spaces there&apos;s this like</p>


    <p>assumption that like</p>


    <p>if you are creating a representation of</p>


    <p>yourself that it like</p>


    <p>that you want to make something that is</p>


    <p>like</p>


    <p>human and that is like a direct kind of</p>


    <p>representational image of</p>


    <p>your like physical body</p>


    <p>um I mean second life is is quite</p>


    <p>counter to this or like one thing that&apos;s</p>


    <p>interesting about second life is</p>


    <p>70 percent</p>


    <p>of the users are male and 70 percent of the</p>


    <p>avatars are female</p>


    <p>um but you can also like one thing about</p>


    <p>that Community is that I mean there are</p>


    <p>tons of furries of course there are like</p>


    <p>lots of people who are embodied as like</p>


    <p>weird stuff like that&apos;s not new and</p>


    <p>that&apos;s like that is a really cool thing</p>


    <p>about Second Life</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>I guess</p>


    <p>I had another another corollary to this</p>


    <p>um right so there&apos;s another thing about</p>


    <p>like</p>


    <p>embodying as say a squirrel right like</p>


    <p>that&apos;s cool but no it&apos;s like nobody is</p>


    <p>going to believe that a squirrel is</p>


    <p>piloting that squirrel right right</p>


    <p>so this is kind of maybe how I think</p>


    <p>about because like one of my my like</p>


    <p>provocations in the first essay which</p>


    <p>was much more like formal and researched</p>


    <p>um was</p>


    <p>was that like the metaverse already</p>


    <p>exists and it&apos;s just the fucking</p>


    <p>internet and so like the reason why</p>


    <p>things like Instagram have been quite</p>


    <p>successful is that like you&apos;re still</p>


    <p>making a representation of yourself out</p>


    <p>of images it just so happens that the</p>


    <p>images you can use are of your actual</p>


    <p>self and they&apos;re not sort of temporarily</p>


    <p>Bound in the way that a synchronous</p>


    <p>Avatar is right and so instead of saying</p>


    <p>an avatar must be synchronous we really</p>


    <p>should be saying that like</p>


    <p>time functions differently in virtual</p>


    <p>space so like for example text tends to</p>


    <p>be persistent which means that you know</p>


    <p>a spoken word can only be heard once but</p>


    <p>uh uh this is not the case in in Virtual</p>


    <p>space right and so your default identity</p>


    <p>is plural that it exists across a lot of</p>


    <p>channels and it exists across time and</p>


    <p>this is</p>


    <p>uh people I think partially do this</p>


    <p>because it can convince convincingly</p>


    <p>resemble your actual self and yet it can</p>


    <p>remain a fiction</p>


    <p>um and so that kind of weaves back to</p>


    <p>the idea that like</p>


    <p>the concept of a stable self or like a</p>


    <p>like stable identity is itself a fiction</p>


    <p>right</p>


    <p>um I&apos;m liking the questions uh this is</p>


    <p>another kind of because it&apos;s like the</p>


    <p>performances themselves are quite</p>


    <p>vulnerable right and then but they&apos;re</p>


    <p>they&apos;re usually billed as something more</p>


    <p>of a lecture right and this is kind of</p>


    <p>the subvert the form of like performance</p>


    <p>of expertise which I resent doing which</p>


    <p>is why I have my little statement about</p>


    <p>being an alleged Pioneer of the Metaverse</p>


    <p>people fucking asked me to talk about it</p>


    <p>and I don&apos;t like it&apos;s like I think this</p>


    <p>whole fucking thing is stupid</p>


    <p>I&apos;m often summoned to</p>


    <p>to form expertise regarding our reported</p>


    <p>transition into the metaverse</p>


    <p>it&apos;s my belief that Computing already</p>


    <p>envelops us in a way that renders it</p>


    <p>invisible I don&apos;t know if I need to go</p>


    <p>to any of the worlds right now</p>


    <p>cool yeah that kind of tied it up great</p>


    <p>judgment</p>


    <p>um to see what kind of questions people</p>


    <p>might have or responses</p>


    <p>like I know I could talk for a million</p>


    <p>years but I want to give other people</p>


    <p>the opportunity to to jump in with a</p>


    <p>question</p>


    <p>if if you have any</p>


    <p>you can also put something in the chat</p>


    <p>if you don&apos;t want to use your out loud</p>


    <p>voice</p>


    <p>oh that&apos;s a good question</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>I&apos;m I&apos;m curious</p>


    <p>in terms of the process of</p>


    <p>making these virtual spaces and like</p>


    <p>because the</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>and then this actually maybe ties into</p>


    <p>the question that is in the chat now um</p>


    <p>so when you&apos;re because the relationship</p>


    <p>to time in this work is so kind of</p>


    <p>multi-faceted and there&apos;s lots of</p>


    <p>iterations and layerings and moving kind</p>


    <p>of like in a loop between IRL and</p>


    <p>um I mean I think Legacy Russell calls</p>


    <p>it calls it like the IRL to AFK Loop</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>and</p>


    <p>so maybe like where do you start like in</p>


    <p>terms of</p>


    <p>are you building</p>


    <p>performance material are you thinking</p>


    <p>about virtual space are you thinking</p>


    <p>about physical space are you thinking</p>


    <p>about like just uh like writing</p>


    <p>and like how</p>


    <p>do you know when</p>


    <p>it&apos;s done</p>


    <p>yes</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>right so</p>


    <p>Finnegan&apos;s Wake is a book that begins</p>


    <p>mid-sentence</p>


    <p>um and so it it forms a loop in time</p>


    <p>right and that that idea was enormously</p>


    <p>compelling to me it was one of the</p>


    <p>reasons why I read the book</p>


    <p>um but and so the the world that</p>


    <p>preceded A Time Capsule or a Grave is</p>


    <p>called well and well is uncapitalized</p>


    <p>followed by a comma which is sort of</p>


    <p>defined as like a mid-sentence opened</p>


    <p>but never shut and so this was a way for</p>


    <p>me to release all of these worlds that</p>


    <p>I&apos;ve been making in private that I</p>


    <p>really at the time because I was kind of</p>


    <p>new was like I don&apos;t really want to call</p>


    <p>this a piece I don&apos;t want it to be done</p>


    <p>but I haven&apos;t really moved it in a while</p>


    <p>and rather than just let it sit in</p>


    <p>private I&apos;m going to expose it and you</p>


    <p>can visit it and I can visit it it&apos;s</p>


    <p>like it&apos;s designed to be incomplete and</p>


    <p>so I really kind of resist the idea of</p>


    <p>completeness like you know I&apos;ve minted</p>


    <p>some NFTs in my life but I&apos;m not really</p>


    <p>it&apos;s like the art world that I Envision</p>


    <p>or that I that I desire doesn&apos;t require</p>


    <p>artists to sell single artifact for</p>


    <p>money</p>


    <p>um and this is because</p>


    <p>I think we&apos;ve kind of moved Beyond</p>


    <p>single identity as human beings and I</p>


    <p>think art no longer really requires a</p>


    <p>single site or a single author</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>and so</p>


    <p>all I view all of my works as processes</p>


    <p>and A Time Capsule Or A Grave is one of them</p>


    <p>and I didn&apos;t really know</p>


    <p>what it was going to be until I started</p>


    <p>doing it</p>


    <p>but I&apos;ve kind of now started to</p>


    <p>understand it as a as a way to kind of</p>


    <p>I call it like autoekphrasis to sort of</p>


    <p>describe the phenomena within the work</p>


    <p>as it&apos;s happening and to kind of weave</p>


    <p>it through with all of these different</p>


    <p>threads so like writing is really</p>


    <p>important and arguably the sort of</p>


    <p>individual Works themselves are are like</p>


    <p>less important</p>


    <p>um but it&apos;s it&apos;s just yeah it&apos;s a</p>


    <p>negotiation</p>


    <p>uh I like series two like I do make</p>


    <p>images</p>


    <p>um and like I it&apos;s like I have an image</p>


    <p>making practice and you know they follow</p>


    <p>themes and I document them and I store</p>


    <p>them in in like a way that I can return</p>


    <p>to later and often these get weaved back</p>


    <p>in in other places like I&apos;ve been making</p>


    <p>that render of the his and hers computer</p>


    <p>for some time before I kind of knew what</p>


    <p>I needed to do with it like I knew what</p>


    <p>it was about but I didn&apos;t know where I</p>


    <p>needed to go so it&apos;s almost like you</p>


    <p>have all of these game assets for this</p>


    <p>like augmented reality game or I can&apos;t</p>


    <p>remember alternate reality game and then</p>


    <p>like you get to sort of install them in</p>


    <p>the World As It Seems appropriate</p>


    <p>so I&apos;m basically a dungeon master</p>


    <p>dming your own life yeah</p>


    <p>yeah I think it makes sense to me that</p>


    <p>like</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>and related to what Sarah&apos;s saying in</p>


    <p>the chat right that like virtual spaces</p>


    <p>kind of as</p>


    <p>a mode</p>


    <p>of housing work or like as a as a medium</p>


    <p>itself like kind of allows for</p>


    <p>like simultaneous Multiplicity</p>


    <p>ooh love that and like I think even in a</p>


    <p>way that like IRL</p>


    <p>installation</p>


    <p>is still</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>like when you move through an IRL</p>


    <p>installation like there are multiple</p>


    <p>things happening but the mode of</p>


    <p>navigation is like embodied right so</p>


    <p>like it enforces of scale</p>


    <p>mm-hmm right you can&apos;t like zoom in and</p>


    <p>out in the way</p>


    <p>you can in a virtual space because like</p>


    <p>even if the work itself is not like</p>


    <p>singular and fixed the physical body</p>


    <p>you&apos;re moving through the space in is</p>


    <p>singular and fixed in that moment in</p>


    <p>time in terms of how you&apos;re moving</p>


    <p>through a room</p>


    <p>and like the built environment like</p>


    <p>reflects a lot of these kind of</p>


    <p>invisible patterns back on you like so</p>


    <p>when when virtual space no longer has</p>


    <p>any physical constraints right like it</p>


    <p>exists to Anchor the mind and it&apos;s I I&apos;m</p>


    <p>always I&apos;m always kind of doing this</p>


    <p>process where it&apos;s like okay you</p>


    <p>identify a phenomenon in Virtual space</p>


    <p>and then you say like oh of course</p>


    <p>physical architecture must also exist to</p>


    <p>Anchor the mind it&apos;s just like the</p>


    <p>anchors are more fixed like the cultural</p>


    <p>package of like I am seeing art in an</p>


    <p>art gallery like has its own weight</p>


    <p>right and so</p>


    <p>there&apos;s a way a strategy that artists</p>


    <p>like Anne Imhoff for example use to</p>


    <p>um like counter this in physical Spaces</p>


    <p>by making installation art</p>


    <p>um so like she filled up Spruth</p>


    <p>Magers Gallery in LA with these huge</p>


    <p>like water tanks to obscure all of the</p>


    <p>walls and the The Works are kind of like</p>


    <p>hidden and like installed above lockers</p>


    <p>that force you to look at it at a</p>


    <p>certain perspective or from a certain</p>


    <p>direction</p>


    <p>um and the thing of like this technique</p>


    <p>is interesting and it works and it&apos;s</p>


    <p>also extraordinarily resource intensive</p>


    <p>right and it&apos;s still a solo artist who&apos;s</p>


    <p>doing this and so you really think I</p>


    <p>think a lot about kind of what is the</p>


    <p>ratio of energy consumption to</p>


    <p>conceptual like expression right and one</p>


    <p>of my great Inspirations and Friends</p>


    <p>Alice Yuan-Zhang has really taken to</p>


    <p>writing over the years because it&apos;s kind</p>


    <p>of the narrowest amount of energy that</p>


    <p>can express the most right</p>


    <p>[Music]</p>


    <p>um and she also does AR and things like</p>


    <p>this but like I mean I have a whole</p>


    <p>other rant about the energy consumption</p>


    <p>of computing and AI and LED screens but</p>


    <p>I&apos;ll skip that for now</p>


    <p>right it&apos;s maybe but maybe let&apos;s all of</p>


    <p>us kind of put a pin in that thought</p>


    <p>because I I will want her revisit it</p>


    <p>later in the semester I think</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>yeah and I think like whether</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>it</p>


    <p>this is making me think about like</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>how writing can function as a virtual</p>


    <p>space</p>


    <p>um oh I actually wanted to talk about</p>


    <p>preservation though right because one of</p>


    <p>the other things about a physical show</p>


    <p>is you might not get to go even if it&apos;s</p>


    <p>like abroad or whatever and then once</p>


    <p>it&apos;s down it&apos;s down it might be</p>


    <p>documented with some photos if maybe</p>


    <p>you&apos;ll get a matterport scan which is</p>


    <p>fine</p>


    <p>um but the a virtual space can be kind</p>


    <p>of a ready-made archive right but the</p>


    <p>more you go out into real-time</p>


    <p>simulation and things like Unity or</p>


    <p>unreal those are horrifically</p>


    <p>unpreservable extreme like their shelf</p>


    <p>life can be like two years unless you&apos;re</p>


    <p>really really intentional about it</p>


    <p>um whereas New Art City is it&apos;s much</p>


    <p>more constrained but it&apos;s built with</p>


    <p>JavaScript and JavaScript is Backward</p>


    <p>Compatible with itself the file sizes</p>


    <p>are quite low and we can export all of</p>


    <p>the code and you can host it on your own</p>


    <p>web server but we&apos;ve made the choice to</p>


    <p>preserve all of these at least for now</p>


    <p>for this sort of like first several</p>


    <p>years of existence as like a ready-made</p>


    <p>archive and there&apos;s more to preservation</p>


    <p>than storage this practice of going</p>


    <p>through a space and talking about it and</p>


    <p>Visually describing it serves a purpose</p>


    <p>for making it more accessible to</p>


    <p>visually impaired users but also this</p>


    <p>like this is one of them like</p>


    <p>documentation is one of the four pillars</p>


    <p>of media art present preservation it&apos;s</p>


    <p>like equally important to Simply storing</p>


    <p>the object right and making it workable</p>


    <p>for the long term so we&apos;re like having</p>


    <p>artists come contribute like oral</p>


    <p>history interviews and exhibition tours</p>


    <p>to this end as as a mode of</p>


    <p>completing this picture of preservation</p>


    <p>yeah and I think a thing</p>


    <p>about like kind of Digital Arts role in</p>


    <p>the larger like Fine Art world is that I</p>


    <p>I&apos;ve often felt that like</p>


    <p>you know the the so broad is to maybe be</p>


    <p>meaningless but like new media art</p>


    <p>um often</p>


    <p>runs into the same some of the same</p>


    <p>problems with preservation as like</p>


    <p>performance art does in that like the</p>


    <p>kind of traditional Gallery system and</p>


    <p>traditional Museum system like doesn&apos;t</p>


    <p>know what to fucking do with it like</p>


    <p>what do what is this is like a thing</p>


    <p>that happened</p>


    <p>and how do we collect it how and how do</p>


    <p>we preserve it when it&apos;s this like</p>


    <p>experiential time-based thing</p>


    <p>um or this like</p>


    <p>um kind of like</p>


    <p>conditional set of experiences or</p>


    <p>something right that</p>


    <p>um and the the question of how do you</p>


    <p>present that how do you document that</p>


    <p>um and like how many works I feel like</p>


    <p>are only exist as like here&apos;s like a</p>


    <p>photograph or here&apos;s like a shitty</p>


    <p>screenshot</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>or like a broken link right and that&apos;s</p>


    <p>what&apos;s what remains of of the work yeah</p>


    <p>I wrote this in the chat so it&apos;s</p>


    <p>documented but I really recommend the</p>


    <p>writing of Annette Decker on this</p>


    <p>subject</p>


    <p>um she&apos;s she&apos;s done like a lot of really</p>


    <p>really cool stuff about digital</p>


    <p>preservation John Ippolito is also like</p>


    <p>a North star of that field</p>


    <p>yeah and I think like it&apos;s really</p>


    <p>valuable and really important that</p>


    <p>you&apos;re</p>


    <p>that like thinking about it</p>


    <p>on the design level like</p>


    <p>as opposed to</p>


    <p>like as an afterthought right like that</p>


    <p>um that kind of like documentation and</p>


    <p>preservation and like what are the ways</p>


    <p>that this work kind of continues to</p>


    <p>exist through time is is like a</p>


    <p>structural question</p>


    <p>and not like a</p>


    <p>a scramble that happens after the thing</p>


    <p>exists and it&apos;s it&apos;s completely</p>


    <p>intertwined with accessibility as well</p>


    <p>that like if you think about</p>


    <p>accessibility from a ground-up</p>


    <p>perspective rather than tacking on alt</p>


    <p>text at the end it it opens up a lot of</p>


    <p>ways to support not just the consumer</p>


    <p>but the creator right</p>


    <p>[Music]</p>


    <p>yeah and like something yeah and I was</p>


    <p>like briefly talking earlier this</p>


    <p>morning about like</p>


    <p>how much like the Primacy of the visual</p>


    <p>is bound up in like the way that we use</p>


    <p>technology most of the time</p>


    <p>um especially the metaverse it&apos;s it&apos;s</p>


    <p>unbelievably retinal</p>


    <p>and that like</p>


    <p>obviously that&apos;s like</p>


    <p>a huge issue of accessibility but it&apos;s</p>


    <p>like also</p>


    <p>I feel like it&apos;s like also like</p>


    <p>illustrative of</p>


    <p>the the kind of like hierarchy that is</p>


    <p>often</p>


    <p>um</p>


    <p>presented in terms of like sensory</p>


    <p>information</p>


    <p>um yeah I mean the reason why we&apos;re</p>


    <p>recording these exhibition tours is we</p>


    <p>tested our accessible catalog view with</p>


    <p>blind visitors and we asked like what&apos;s</p>


    <p>your preferred mode say going to a</p>


    <p>museum or going to an art show and the</p>


    <p>consensus was that sure having visual</p>


    <p>descriptions is great but having the</p>


    <p>artist there to speak on the work is</p>


    <p>more resonant and that kind of stands to</p>


    <p>reason right that like</p>


    <p>a person who doesn&apos;t use their eyes is</p>


    <p>maybe not going to have a visual</p>


    <p>experience of or it&apos;s like not going to</p>


    <p>sort of that&apos;s not the way their</p>


    <p>imagination works right so like hearing</p>


    <p>the artist describe the interrelations</p>


    <p>and the subjectivity is like it&apos;s like a</p>


    <p>more resonant way to do it but I found</p>


    <p>that like</p>


    <p>some of my friends over 40 will be like</p>


    <p>I&apos;ve never played video games before</p>


    <p>it&apos;s like accessing a 3D space is</p>


    <p>confusing and like have also like</p>


    <p>completely appreciated just being able</p>


    <p>to hear the artist right mm-hmm</p>


    <p>right I mean I think it&apos;s like an</p>


    <p>illustration that like</p>


    <p>being accessible in one set of ways is</p>


    <p>like often also useful to</p>


    <p>like in broader applications</p>


    <p>yeah</p>


    <p>well I guess we&rsquo;re reaching time and y&apos;all</p>


    <p>have been in class for three hours so I</p>


    <p>would be tired if I was you yeah yeah</p>


    <p>does anyone have any like last</p>


    <p>um thoughts or questions before we</p>


    <p>disappear into the day</p>


    <p>an experimental art practice I want to</p>


    <p>know more about like a direction that</p>


    <p>you&apos;re maybe wanting</p>


    <p>I have my little Post-it note of ideas</p>


    <p>um yeah I mean I may I may make a sort</p>


    <p>of two channel film with like a live</p>


    <p>performance component</p>


    <p>um I&apos;m interested in audio like making</p>


    <p>upon like releasing art as a podcast</p>


    <p>um as like sort of a sound collage essay</p>


    <p>those are those are like some some fun</p>


    <p>ideas I&apos;m thinking about but there&apos;s a</p>


    <p>point where people just keep asking you</p>


    <p>to do shit so I just like I keep having</p>


    <p>to do shit and I I can&apos;t I can&apos;t like go</p>


    <p>make new work</p>


    <p>but I&apos;m excited about this this possibly</p>


    <p>this new era where we both just start</p>


    <p>making two channel films yeah yeah</p>


    <p>um and y&apos;all if you if you ever have any</p>


    <p>questions for me you can email me</p>


    <p>&nbsp;it&apos;s free to sign up for new art city</p>


    <p>but if you need more space to accomplish</p>


    <p>a project just let me know we have a ton</p>


    <p>of documentation if you&apos;re new to things</p>


    <p>like blender or web accessibility</p>


    <p>um and our Discord is a helpful place to</p>


    <p>ask questions</p>


    <p>amazing well thank you so much this was</p>


    <p>so interesting and so fun and</p>


    <p>yeah I&apos;m so stoked</p>


    <p>um thank you yeah I&apos;m really really glad</p>

    <div class="content">
    <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing until it was already done.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>A Time Capsule Or A Grave is a hybrid performance project initially commissioned by the Tezos Foundation for Octobre Num&eacute;rique Faire Monde in Arles, France in October 2022. The piece takes no definite form. It is my first serious attempt to involve performance in my practice. What began as a fictionalized performance of expertise becomes an earnest performance of ignorance. The work exists in a hybrid format. I activate a persistent virtual space on New Art City with IRL performances, the audio of which are recorded and installed spatially in the virtual after each iteration. This essay is itself a momentary capsule of subjectivity.</p>
    <p>A week before I went to perform the piece for the first time at Octobre Numerique Faire Monde, Lauren Lee McCarthy introduced me to her idea of a &ldquo;performance in progress.&rdquo; I had already planned to record the audio from the first performance and install clips in this space at each place I spoke, but Lauren sparked the idea that I could perform the piece multiple times.</p>
    <p>My late husband, Tvordis Veeler, was obsessed with Finnegans Wake. One idea that forms the book&rsquo;s internal logic comes from The New Science of Giambattista Vico. According to Vico, the cyclical structure of history loops through three ages: divine, heroic, and human. Joyce modifies the schema to include a ricorso between cycles which I view something like eddying out on the river of time. As I write this, A Time Capsule or A Grave has been performed four times. The ricorso came second through a collaboration with Emji St. Spero.</p>
    <p>Production of each age in this first cycle of performances formed a tightening temporal lo</p>

    <p>* Academic in tone and rigor</p>
    <p>* Edited by Mai Ishikawa Sutton, Charlotte Strange, and Stitch</p>
    <p>* Tightly composed, rigidly performed</p>
    <p>* Fictional, stylized</p>
    <p>2: Ricorso: What Will You Be Like Before, What Were You Like After (20 minutes)</p>

    <p>* Conversation with previous recordings</p>
    <p>* Who is speaking?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So did I design them this way? With the Viconian cycle in mind?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>No. It is a comfortable frame from my former literary obsession with which to name the phenomena I&rsquo;ve observed in this process.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Wait. You said your husband was the Joycean.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Tvordis is my previous avatar&ndash; an identity to which I am wedded but which is no longer alive. This fiction was not revealed as fiction until the third iteration of the performance.</p>
    <p>Increments of time and space have the same statistical character as the whole. In the same way, I hope this essay will mirror the constellation of objects and processes that make up this work.</p>
    <p>This first cycle of exploration has revealed that the process of observing and naming particularities in this world must be central to the work going forward. Indeed it has defined all of the efforts leading here as well.</p>
    <p>Words spiral out of the rupture of an encounter with a past self as other and the future self as self. The best way to show my future self what I can&rsquo;t see today is to get out of my own way and try to name the sensations. Even though I made these worlds and everything in them, the internal logic here remains unclear. I still get lost. The process of this piece is becoming a pataphysical study of the phenomena taking place here.</p>

    </div>


    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b><i>His And Hers</i></b><br><i class=subscript>January 17, 2023</i></button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Hello. Um, I&apos;m Sammie Veeler. I&apos;m so overjoyed to see so many familiar faces here who I&apos;ve gotten to know over the last year or two. Um, if you don&apos;t know me, yes, my name is Sammie. Uh, I&apos;m an artist and I also run a virtual art space called New Art City, which we founded in March of 2020. Um, and so my art practice and my curatorial practice through this virtual space.</p>
    <p>And my life as a woman have all coincided in the last three years. And so I guess my remarks tonight will kind of weave through how those threads are in common. Um, and I&apos;m so grateful to be sort of showing this culmination of You know, several years of development that was, I mean, it really develops thanks to so many people who are here right now.</p>
    <p>Peter, Nancy, Jesse, Alice, Huntress, Meike, oh my goodness. It&apos;s just like, it&apos;s really, I&apos;m so grateful because, I don&apos;t know, I was learning what type of artist I wanted to be, surrounded by so many people who I so respected and admired. And I&apos;m really grateful to call so many of you friends. Um, so I guess I&apos;ll sit back down at my computer and we&apos;ll talk about this image here.</p>
    <p>I think a lot about the transits between physical space and virtual space as similar to transits from the body to some sort of disembodied state. You know, if you think about a metaphor of living and dying, we&apos;re each embodied in this sort of container. and extruded through time like a playhead on a cassette player.</p>
    <p>All time has already happened, and we&apos;re only experiencing it linearly. And so, if you think about what makes a world, it took me a long time to figure that out, even though I run this virtual art space, right? And, sort of, trying to uncover the internal logics of what it means to exist in virtual space has been really important to me, not just as an artist, but also as running a virtual space, which was founded before the, you know, the use of the metaverse saw this resurgence. And so I&apos;m constantly asking myself, what is virtual embodiment? What is trust? What is a sovereign identity online? And so, as we think about these transits between physical and virtual, this image attempts to perhaps visualize the metaphor that I&apos;m trying to talk about here</p>
    <p>So on the left, you see an old Macintosh, and the stickers on it are actually the same stickers on the laptop I&apos;m using. And on the right, is my late husband Tvordis. You can see the man himself here on the screen. And that is his personal computer, which he calls Theseus. Um, and I&apos;ve taken on this role of archivist of this artifact</p>
    <p>Um, and sort of my contact with the artifacts there, the things that he was too afraid to call art. And, I now get to be the curator of this archive. And it&apos;s not just, you know, touching an artifact. It&apos;s a portal through time between me and this other person. And so, the internet transmits something which is not encodable.</p>
    <p>As we move towards embodiment, this is how I view myself in virtual space. This is a poor resolution image, but we are, after all, always copies in motion. I think as a trans person, do I really want another body? Do I want one body? Have I not learned already through my own experience that identity is mutable and that&apos;s part of the fun?</p>
    <p>So let&apos;s zoom out a little bit more. This is kind of what my work looks like. Um, right, this is an NFT. I&apos;ve always been somewhat suspicious of, not suspicious, but I dream of a utopia in which exchange of artifact for money is not what determines the sort of value or sustenance of an artistic practice.</p>
    <p>And so I really view, and I view my work as like, sort of, a process rather than a static artifact. But, um, yes, like, what is immutable and what is sort of, like, how can we sort of embrace mutability?</p>
    <p>My previous NFT was actually curated by... Jesse.</p>
    <p>And so we see this same image again, and now it&apos;s in a photoreal replica of the living room that man lived in and made that art he didn&apos;t call art. And so I think about this atemporality, the telephone line between the past self and the current self, and the work we can do in this eternal present to open those channels.</p>
    <p>In some sense I feel like a telephone operator, which is one of those female computers that existed before mechanical computers.</p>
    <p>Let&apos;s switch spaces.</p>
    <p>So I think about time kind of like a fractal. And each of these artifacts I make somehow are a blueprint of what comes after. This was kind of my previous attempt to do what I&apos;m doing tonight. And this is a fascinating thing about living in the virtual is my visual practice began when I joined this virtual space.</p>
    <p>And I guess to zoom out on what New Art City does is you can make a 3D multiplayer website without code. You can upload images, video, audio, 3D shapes, and text, which is horrifically illegible because I made the sky black for some reason. And this is another way to explore atemporality, uh, in text. And so now you can kind of see it in an abstract form that there are paragraphs, but there&apos;s no real linear progression in which to read them.</p>
    <p>And this is a map of all the visual art I&apos;ve ever made.</p>
    <p>I began kind of with a series of seven of these low resolution worlds in progress that have these sort of specific interactions that are. Governing how they work.</p>
    <p>They look like shit, to be honest. Or like, I&apos;m much better at modeling now. But it&apos;s so strange to be here in this world I privately inhabited and see all of these beautiful mistakes. And I think that&apos;s what has kind of moved me about this archival process is these are capsules of subjectivity. My thoughts don&apos;t need to be lapidary.</p>
    <p>It&apos;s really like to be in contact with all of the things that I can&apos;t see in the present as a future self. So I&apos;m in this world encoding a future past.</p>
    <p>Talk about amnesia.</p>
    <p>So I made a piece about this essay. Which I wrote for a collection of sound art that, uh, I made in my previous life. So we&apos;ll zoom out on this metaphor. Who&apos;s this husband character? Who the fuck is Tvordis Veeler? I share his name, right?</p>
    <p>It&apos;s a metaphor. I woke up one day with this guy&apos;s memories, and his clothes, and his synthesizers.</p>
    <p>And I have to sort of, sort out, which of these things belong to me? And so, as we talk in Web 3 about a sovereign identity online, what about my own identity is sovereign?</p>
    <p>And I&apos;m lost. In a world that I myself made.</p>
    <p>Where is that sound coming from?</p>
    <p>Ah. Sorry about that. Okay.</p>
    <p>Alright, alright, alright. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. So, this performance was initially conceived, mm, something like a polemic wrapped in a eulogy.</p>
    <p>I wanted to talk about, mm, the ways I view the, the sort of popular conception of the metaverse as, mm, maybe deficient, or maybe to try to explore the phenomenology of living online in the first place, rather than inventing a new game mechanic for doing so, right?</p>
    <p>But I was also trying to talk about what it feels like to be trans and try to embody this metaphor of the dead husband because what I found was when I would bring this up, people would follow up, whether it was a metaphor or to sort of seriously inquire about my status as a widow. And this is something I&apos;m trying to overcome when you make art with computers.</p>
    <p>It&apos;s quite easy to make something that looks cool. And what I&apos;m so concerned with is what comes after that</p>
    <p>Oh, there we are again.</p>
    <p>So part of the process here with this performance is each time I perform it, I record it. And so, thank God, I don&apos;t have to do as much of the talking. I really don&apos;t love to opine, and I usually don&apos;t prepare remarks. So part of what I&apos;m trying to do tonight is... Embody that, because in the previous two performances I like actually sat down and wrote an essay and it&apos;s not really like me.</p>
    <p>So it feels kind of vulnerable to not prepare remarks, but in some sense I&apos;m trying to put myself in an embodied state in relation to this virtual world. And we can see that the documentation that&apos;s installed there is different from the word itself. In physical space, a spoken word can only be heard once.</p>
    <p>But text online is persistent. And so my body and this dead man&apos;s body are more or less made of the same stuff up there. And so what is, what does it mean, like, what parameters are different when a world sort of permits persistence in speech?</p>
    <p>That&apos;s me! I see the avatar more like clothes than a body. Mmm. You&apos;re only one part visual, and avatars can kind of contain as much fiction as you like. It&apos;s part of the fun.</p>
    <p>Shut up.</p>
    <p>The documentation of the previous performance is really garbled, and I just like to think that, you know, that line between now and then Is somehow like a shark&apos;s chewing on the undersea cable or something.</p>
    <p>I tied it up again last time, but honestly, I feel like, uh, this is as much time as I need to spend here. Um, I&apos;m happy to open it up to questions if anything&apos;s unclear. Um, this one is definitely more jumbled because I didn&apos;t write anything down before.</p>
    <p>Yeah, um, it&apos;s kind of, yeah, the sound work is interesting, because it was like, I was allegedly a sound artist before I was making this kind of worlding stuff, and I see a lot of parallels between the work I was making then and sort of the worlds that I make now. Um, I work a lot with tape, um, and I made an archive of about twelve tapes, you know, using synthesizers and field recordings and whatever.</p>
    <p>And then I would record them again onto additional cassettes and give them away as gifts. And I was thinking about sort of archiving a single state of this piece of variable media and like what the documentation captures and what is sort of unencodable in that documentation. So I&apos;m speaking conceptually.</p>
    <p>I use some synthesizers. I use some computers. You know, the boy liked the tools. I, I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m interested in the processes.</p>
    <p>Yes, that&apos;s the fun part about this. It&apos;s like, you get to share physical space with a living Sammie, but these are all online, and so the process will continue to evolve them. So if you want to explore this on your own, and hear things that I didn&apos;t walk up to, I didn&apos;t walk up to everything here, you can visit it on newart.city/world/well</p>
    <p>Um, or if you search A Time Capsule or a Grave on Google, it will come up. Um, And, yeah, the sort of persistence of that world and the ephemerality of this physical world, I think, is, I&apos;m trying to draw that connection between, um, what can be embodied physically and what is preserved virtually.</p>
    <p>So this exists in the exchange, and the NFT that&apos;s minted today is kind of like a single state of that, the, the existence. And I guess another thing to mention is that it has an unlockable, which includes an image file, a GLTF 3D file, and the Blender file that created it. And so, like, we recognize that the image is kind of only one part of this piece, and I want to think about, sort of, the difference between storage and preservation.</p>
    <p>So, these files are remanded to your custody. What do you do with them? And, like, I think mutation is a really good strategy for preserving things, and you&apos;re more than welcome to do so. But I, yeah, I invite you to think about, sort of, what preservation means to you, and what, sort of, spending time with a media file means to you.</p>
    <p>There&apos;s a way in which... Time that has already passed by you is inert and unchangeable, right? And in the same way, when you, when you capture a file, it&apos;s kind of like a single, a single snapshot in time of a moving process. Um, and so I think that&apos;s, that&apos;s kind of a way that I think about time, that like, speaking has to be experienced in a linear fashion.</p>
    <p>You can&apos;t speak two sentences at once. You can&apos;t really like talk backwards. But, you know, everything that you put online is now kind of like, it&apos;s no longer burdened by time in that way, and like, this is a really potent metaphor for me to think about, you know, contacting previous versions of myself.</p>
    <p>And I think, I don&apos;t know, the easiest word to describe this process is magic. It&apos;s like, you, you&apos;re connected by this wire and it&apos;s transmitting data, but the things that the data, the wire can&apos;t capture are like, You know, the ineffable quality of being, right?</p>
    <p>Yeah, I mean, it&apos;s been interesting to do this, this is the fourth time I&apos;ve done a performance since, I guess the third time in L. A. since the performance that I initially delivered at the festival in France. And like, what I&apos;m doing here is kind of a gift to my future self in the same way that all of these capsules of subjectivity are gifts to me now.</p>
    <p>Um, that like, these are the first four performances I&apos;ve ever given. And I have this documentation of these ways in which a year from now I&apos;m probably gonna look back at myself and say, Wow, what a fucking idiot. And like, if I do that, I&apos;ve fucking grown. Um. And I, I mean, I think that&apos;s, that&apos;s the reason why I do this process.</p>
    <p>Um, and so, you know, it&apos;s always hard to know when something is done, but I, yeah, this, the metaphor of a well is kind of, part of how the previous piece, Well, was a, a blueprint of what came beyond that, like, I&apos;m exploding the word. It begins mid sentence, and it&apos;s uncapitalized, and there&apos;s a comma after it.</p>
    <p>It&apos;s a fucking nightmare to write about, but, um, the concept is... It begins mid sentence and never ends. The word well refers to a place to draw water from, which is both sort of inspiration or, or sustenance, right? But the word colloquially well can basically go in every single direction. It can begin a sentence, it can pause a sentence, it can invite somebody else to speak, it can end a sentence.</p>
    <p>And so this is maybe a way I&apos;m trying to sort of... Get out of the linear conception of words that we experience in the real world and so in the same way I think the uniting metaphors of this piece are like drawing a lot of things out of me And I&apos;m learning a lot of my things about myself as I do it and I&apos;m trying to document it in I don&apos;t know an interesting way or whatever. So I&apos;ll probably keep doing it and then when I feel like it&apos;s done, it&apos;ll be done.</p>
    <p>Oh yeah, yeah, New Art City. Um, I&apos;ll pull up the edition and then I&apos;ll talk about my job.</p>
    <p>Right, so, New Art City, um, is a virtual art space, right? We&apos;ve been around for a while. I mean, and, I feel like we... We&apos;ve shown like 4, 000 plus artists since March of 2020 across about 160 shows. And, um, we&apos;ve, we don&apos;t have any like blockchain stuff encoded in it. We really try to focus on the presentation layer to make something that&apos;s really expressive and unusual to get out of the kind of like skeuomorph of like having a body or whatever.</p>
    <p>And so as a result, like every single space is completely fucking different. Um, and, um, Yeah, it&apos;s all public online and you can go visit them. And this is the edition.</p>
    <p>Okay, everyone. That&apos;s going to wrap it up for the performance tonight. Thank you for being here. Hopefully we see you next week.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b><i>About My Avatar</i></b><br><i class=subscript>January 12, 2023</i></button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>[0] A Time Capsule Or A Grave is a lecture I initially developed for an art and technology festival in France called Octobre Numerique Faire Monde. I am allegedly a pioneer of the so called metaverse and I am often summoned to perform expertise on the matter. It is not characteristic of me to prepare remarks. I typically dress like I am dressed here and chain smoke through each address as an anti-professional statement. This persona, Miss Sammie, is my current avatar. I describe the original lecture as a polemic wrapped in a eulogy.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I have found myself writing this same eulogy over and over since I transitioned. Forgetting is the left hand of memory. Art becomes a portal through time, a potent channel activated only after you&rsquo;ve forgotten making the artifact. Silly me, before I even called it art, the blueprint was written. We can come back to now, it will always be here.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see what I knew before I knew what I was talking about. In those days, &nbsp;I made worlds with sound which I now realize were the prototypes of the world projected behind me. Interposed in my remarks tonight are two essays written in Fall of 2020 to accompany two releases in a four-part sound art collection, which I created or compiled in the interstitial zone between my past self and my current self. For this brief moment we passed each other on a sandbar circumgirded by deep ocean.</p>
    <h3>Provincial Skinflint - December 11, 2015</h3>
    <p>[0&rsquo; &rarr; 1?] Six Tape Works and One Exploded Composition are the left and right hands. Provincial Skinflint is the feet. I reencountered Audacity, a free Digital Audio Workstation, through a French dictation assignment and saw that it was possible to cut and splice strips of audio much like one does with analog tape. I was immediately enthralled. I said at the time that it felt more like compulsion than creation. The same can be said for most of my music.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I was abroad without any of my guitar toys as crutches. I was experiencing the early joys of dysphoria and the early dividends of trauma. I needed to make music. Thank goodness I found a way to do so. I admit these are intentionally rough around the edges, but they form the foundation of my field collaging practice.</p>
    <p>I later learned this is called musique concrete. Reading Eliane Radigue&apos;s &apos;Intermediary Spaces,&apos; I felt immense kinship with her work and her airplanes. She only got to hear six per day when she lived in Nice with no tape recorder. She wrote a timetable so she wouldn&apos;t miss them. I couldn&apos;t keep airplanes out of my field recordings if I tried. Neither of us could keep whatever that sound was out of our minds. The listening was the site of her work and mine, the artifact itself is secondary.</p>
    <p>The Tvordis Veeler mask was constructed at this time too, a mechanism I now realize was defense. This is Tvordis&apos;s first work of art, and I, Sammie, remain a faithful archivist of his oeuvre after his passing. Some say I was his muse, but I wouldn&apos;t be so self important. Like Eliane, I didn&apos;t see the significance of what I was doing and feeling until much later. Before this was art, it was a game.</p>
    <p>Audacity has been more important to my work than any guitar, pedal, plugin, or synthesizer. And it&apos;s free. It&apos;s obvious that I didn&apos;t make this music to get famous, or even to make people happy. I made this because I needed to.</p>
    <p>With this triptych of hands and feet finally resolved, perhaps my next work will come nearer to my body.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>Back To Now</h3>
    <p>[2&rarr;3] I see the avatar more like clothes than a body. Avatars can contain as much fiction as you like. That is part of the fun. You are only one part visual- an expansive domain to experiment in, but far from the only one. This recurring shape in my work is a visual manifestation of Miss Sammie. I don&rsquo;t always have a body online and I enjoy the internet&rsquo;s ability to facilitate disembodied experience. But when I have to have just one, this is what I look like.</p>
    <p>It took me two months to write an essay about being trans while also polemicizing the metaverse for a predominantly cis, straight audience at the intersection of art and technology. It was one of the more difficult works of art I have ever made. &nbsp;My tone was stern and urgent. I played a character of the female archivist preserving the legacy of the dead male artist. The polemic was for them. The eulogy is for you.</p>
    <p>The metaphor of death, which I did not reveal as a metaphor to the festival audience, was one of those negotiations trans people use to trick the cis into seeing us. I think it is safe to assume the audience of an all trans performance program does not need the same coddling. So let me drop the metaphor and speak frankly.</p>
    <p>I think many of us are familiar with the oversimplifications we use to make ourselves legible to cis people. Some are more pernicious than others. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I was a woman trapped in a man&rsquo;s body&rdquo; presupposes a self divided in two discrete and opposing entities when in reality we are not one, two, ten, or ten thousand. Identity is an uncountable quantity. Or, as weapon, &ldquo;you killed my son, daughter, husband, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s follow the fiction further into its logic and re-imagine the relationship between the dead and living versions of the self not as violence, but as collaboration. I have long used the metaphor of a &ldquo;dead husband&rdquo; to describe the man I used to live as. He made up the name Tvordis Veeler, the surname of which I retained after transition. We were married after all. I often use the dead husband terminology in conversation without explaining it. Almost every time I do, a while later the person I was speaking to would follow up either asking if it was a metaphor, or inquiring seriously about my status as a widow. Either way, the thought sat with them.</p>
    <h3>Field Collage - September 2020</h3>
    <p>[3&rarr;4] I made Provincial Skinflint from my immediately accessible environment of sounds while I was abroad using the internet, my iPhone, and sounds generated by the Audacity software.</p>
    <p>I made these sound collages in 2016/17. This was the first use of the name &apos;field collage&apos; to describe this process of washing and sorting sounds from my world. I always saw these like foley for a movie that never happened, or a movie witnessed only by me, but which implicates many others in various crimes against art. These are virtual spaces.</p>
    <p>In 2015 I started using Audacity to generate confrontational and confusing sounds as Provincial Skinflint. Incongruity because I liked the grate of it. I suppose I had some things to confront.</p>
    <p>The old mask hurt. This was a way to scream without anyone hearing me. I came home as Tvordis. He was a very good mask. I was home from my first time abroad alone with a new me to be. I should have known that the solution to feeling masked is not to make a better mask, but I don&apos;t regret the effort.</p>
    <p>I wanted to make these sound collages as gifts for my friends. I wanted to be a person who makes gifts for her friends. I genuinely don&apos;t know what pronoun is appropriate here. I was a girl who didn&apos;t know she was a girl, but I was cultivating a masculinity. What grew was a peculiar shape indeed. It was a performance which I realize now was too deliberate to be convincing. Nonetheless it delighted most participants in the work.</p>
    <p>fc2 is a self portrait of the little rock I wanted to be when I started my 22 year old life again again. 40 seconds, just some nice water I found.</p>
    <p>I listened to this album often and made sounds like this for myself regularly that I discarded when I was finished playing. It was the music I wanted to listen to. The trains in Paris, the rain everywhere, my friends in Chicago, myself the tiniest bit, speaking rarely but fumbling the recorder constantly. I am here, you don&apos;t need me to tell you.</p>
    <p>When I field collage I usually wait until I&apos;ve forgotten some of what was recorded where. It sparks my mental images much better than a typical picture. This is a project of memory and forgetting.</p>
    <h3>Returning to the Avatar</h3>
    <p>[5] Tvordis was my previous avatar. A peculiar type of fiction. He is a virtual representation of my previous fictional identity as a man. My deadname is actually Sam Cortese. I created Tvordis as a survival strategy and he stayed with me for my last six years in the egg. He was a caricature of masculinity, a woman dressing up a doll while she waits to be born. A composite of Kerouac and Hunter S. Thompson, he favored Hawaiian shirts, Canadian tuxedos, and Marlboro reds. He was always famous, but nobody could quite figure out for what. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>The persistent virtual residue of his being remains. In the wired, he and I are made of the same substance. I speak of him as if he is an external entity but of course, he was not piloting that mechanical man, I was. Tvordis didn&rsquo;t die, he lived. I inherited his clothes, his body, his memories, and his personal data. My task in transition is to sort through these artifacts and decide which belong to me.</p>
    <p>[6] He first manifested online through a composite of curated images and text. He made his transformation real by changing his name on Facebook. In the physical world, speech is not persistent. A spoken word can only be heard once. A world whose internal logic permits persistence in speech allows words to become part of your body. In the virtual, words flow around you like hair. Organic but not technically alive. Tethered temporarily to a living being and extant after slipping the bond.</p>
    <p>We are aware that work by male artists is more valuable when they sign it and even more valuable when they die. They are remanded to the custody of archivists: the handmaids of history, who are indeed predominantly women. The machinery of a history from which we are often absent. In this fiction, Tvordis is in on the joke. While he failed to sign his work, he performed the labor of dying, dutifully entrusting me with his archive so I could begin the work of preserving his legacy.</p>
    <p>The first lecture ended with the punchline you already heard: &ldquo;Today I perform for you in the flesh. Tomorrow, the audio recording of this lecture will be installed in the virtual space, and online visitors will share space with a dead version of me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I will add the voices from each subsequent performance to form an ever-expanding chorus of dead Sammies.</p>

    <p>On the internet, nobody knows you are a dog. Nobody knows you are a singular person. Indeed, nobody knows you are still alive. The networked age has shifted the production of history from a one-to-many to a many-to-many process. Not only does everyone produce history, they become historians as well.</p>
    <p>Art&rsquo;s role in historical production has shifted along the same lines. Information is abundant and making meaning from it is now a collective responsibility. We must not confuse information for memory. Information exists in the machine. Memory is constituted in the body.</p>
    <p>I address you in my capacity as the title executor of the estate of Tvordis Veeler, my late husband, and as a curator whose work concerns digital preservation of cultural memory. I am the steward of my husband&rsquo;s most intimate digital device: his personal computer which he called Theseus. The worlds we will traverse are moments outside time between two local machines: his and hers.</p>
    <p>These worlds were created in constellation with peers who guided and inspired my work. Exhibited alongside me in this festival, Heesoo Kwon, Henrique Fagundes, Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley, Kiki Wu, and the Daad Futurist collective use spiritual worlding practice to process generational history, develop speculative futures, and project their souls outward into cyberspace.</p>
    <p>________________</p>
    <p>It is well known that art appreciates in value after the death of the artist.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What death are we considering?</p>
    <p>The soul departing the body? Or the voice departing its origin?</p>
    <p>In the twilight of his life, he promised me his computer and challenged me to &ldquo;examine this archive of a mask in its incompleteness.&rdquo; To lift these files out of their grave and put them in places they would never expect to find themselves. Through this gift of his un-curated digital self, he ensured I would never be alone in my grief.</p>
    <p>Theseus is so named because Tvordis replaced every part of it multiple times over. The only part which remains from when Tvordis was alive is the solid state hard drive. When you replace every part of a computer, is it still the same computer?</p>
    <p>Solid state drives store data by trapping electrons in structures called charge traps. It holds the same electrons in those charge traps until the files are deleted. Tvordis has left the physical body, yet he is visible through his gathered artifacts. The moments he captured documented his presence. By handling those files, we touch the same physical substance.</p>
    <p>I view Theseus as living documentation of this performance astride two worlds. Much of the performances themselves were ephemeral and undocumentable. Tvordis evaded the fixity of the exhibition wall label by refusing to distinguish what of his output was art and what wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p>The aura of these electrons is not the end of the story. The hard drive in his computer is already past its recommended usage period and will inevitably fail. Jon Ippolito famously tells us that &ldquo;fixity equals death&hellip; new media art can survive only by multiplying and mutating.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>It will be a lifelong grief ritual to preserve this archive by transforming it and making meaning from it. Each obelisk in this world leads out to others. What I do with my husband&rsquo;s artifacts I also do with my own.</p>
    <p>________________</p>
    <p>I am often summoned to perform expertise regarding our purported transition to the metaverse. Computing already envelops us at all times in a way that renders it invisible. In the metaverse, heaven is a data center. We are there together now. We have lived there for over a decade already.</p>
    <p>Logging onto the internet is a way to leave the body. Logging on is no longer an intentional process but a natural state of existence. It is easier to log on than it is to log off, easier to store a file than it is to delete it. Our default state is disembodied and our default identity is plural. In the data center, our virtual souls are mixed together as anonymized digital residue.</p>
    <p>What does it mean when a society collectively and involuntarily astral projects, casting data shadows as we travel? We are always in the presence of our own ghosts. Ancestors may be more apt. We constantly depart and reinhabit this new networked world. Our consciousnesses exist astride embodiment and disembodiment. To leave the body can be both dehumanizing and liberating.</p>
    <p>________________</p>
    <p>Tvordis was born here in France. The name Tvordis Veeler was a fabrication&ndash; a mask which he assumed one night while he was studying in Paris during his third year at University and never removed. He made this act real by changing his name on Facebook. Masks reflect new intentions back on the wearer. I am awed by the great lengths he went to trying to find comfort in the masculinity he felt obligated to perform.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He hated being a man and resented the respect accorded to him by other men. With a subtle shift in framing, he began to view his life as a performance. This was the difference between drowning and diving.</p>
    <p>It is significant that Tvordis first embodied his mask in virtual space. Reformulating and speculatively performing ones identity through the virtual is a time-honored tradition of the internet. Once he returned to school, people who had never met him IRL began addressing him by his chosen name and gradually the virtual performance intruded on the real.</p>
    <p>________________</p>
    <p>The architecture of the internet obscures the fact that you always travel with an avatar. The only difference between this and Second Life is the avatar can convincingly resemble your actual self. &nbsp;We must not make the mistake of identifying ourselves through the masks that we wear. Is the avatar your virtual embodiment? Why should we assume a singular identity online?</p>
    <p>Plato describes sight as an active process&ndash; our eyes project beams onto the world, reflecting it back to us. We now understand that sight functions in exactly the opposite way. This is, however, exactly the way cameras work in interactive 3D worlds through a process called ray-casting.</p>
    <p>The camera sees actively. Does this mean you do the same? The avatar is your clothes, but it is not your body. In virtual space, you are embodied as a camera and you see by casting beams out of your eyes. This sight does not necessarily confer presence. Presence, like listening, is active.</p>
    <p>________________</p>
    <p>Many of the artifacts Tvordis left behind were stereophonic field recordings and sound collages created from those recordings. These, too, are virtual spaces and he viewed them that way. He captured field recordings to construct incongruous sound spaces with them. His sound-worlds are embodied time, experienced durationally. They only perform their objecthood when they are accessed. These worlds, like all media files, are always accessed in translation. They point back to an invisible original.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In his recordings he took care to make himself invisible, but he is present with us as a fellow listener. In five years of his field recordings I have not found a single trace of his voice. His absence, however, is a form of presence drawn out through his mistakes. I feel him when he jostles the recorder, jingles his keys, and clicks his tongue to test the shape of the room.</p>
    <p>I argue that a virtual space can be defined as a third space between two or more physical spaces. These can be localized in both space and time. Tvordis is only alone in his field recordings when I am not there to listen with him. When I join him in these spaces he left for me, our virtual selves are equally unburdened by time and the body. The boundary between our consciousnesses blurs. On the other side of time there is a hand reaching back to you; however, you must choose to grasp it.</p>
    <p>Can you be sure which hand is yours?</p>
    <p>________________</p>
    <p>Tvordis imagined things for me that he refused to imagine for himself and our time together was painfully brief. As soon as I felt he could really see me, he was almost gone. He could envision me here in front of you more clearly than I could. It is ironic that as his life ended, mine seemed to begin.</p>
    <p>And so here I am walking through the world he spoke into existence, handling this mass of material he called his archive, which he never attempted to organize, and shared with no one. He left it for me to untangle in his wake.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He viewed his life as a work of art, but he left before a suitable venue emerged to exhibit it. He poured art out of himself autonomically&ndash; it seemed so easy for him to accept what came and yet he failed to publish any of his work. I feel it is my duty to construct a mutable biography of this strange man from the documentation he left behind.</p>
